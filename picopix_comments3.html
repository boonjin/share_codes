It's completely the norm that early backers and late backers have same terms or better. It rewards early backers for getting a campaign going. Your free shipping seems scammy,really scammy.

Is this campaign really being run by the corporate team from Philips? Please check not a scam?

Correct, the zoom is not optical it is only digital. Digital zoom out effectively removes pixels all the way around the image to make it smaller which technically reduces it from 1080p (total number of pixels on screen) to lower than that, but considering it is 1080p, i.e. there are a lot of pixels, you won't notice too much loss in quality. The ideal scenario is to set the zoom to maximum screen size so that it uses every pixel.</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px"></div></div>


<div id="MzY=">Floris Weerbrouck :  
<pre style="margin-left: 50px">Perhaps the same question as Adam Wilson down below. Is it correct that there is no optical zoom, only digital? So for each distance from the wall, there is an "ideal" screen size? The digital zoom leads to some quality loss I assume?</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Hello, yes there is a digital zoom. And there is no loss when going down.</pre>

<pre style="margin-left: 50px">Hi again. A couple of questions:

1. Can you give us an update on the review video? when will it be released?
2. Can you tell me if you have an update on the video sync fix for Bluetooth speakers I mentioned to guarantee all Bluetooth speakers can be in perfect sync

Thank you :)</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Hello
1: as previously said: we won't give anymore deadline for news to avoid any issues
2: we will check this later on and keep you posted.</pre>
 ⤷  lukesavvides :  
<pre>OK thank you :)</pre>
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>The BT audio and video will be in sync when playing supported codecs using system APIs, by following standard latency compensation algorithm. But real-time media like games or the whole system cannot be synchronized as doing so will add latency to the whole projector’s display. For users who require low latency audio for real-time applications, Bluetooth is not suitable regardless of the codec used (like aptX). aptX for example only goes as low as 32ms. This is not enough for most music programs</pre>
 ⤷  lukesavvides :  
<pre>Hi, Yes this is why there should be the option for the user to add video latency if they want to. So if you are playing games then you would not use it. But if you watch movies and videos (which will be the most use case for this product) there should be an option to adjust latency in the video. Some bluetooth speakers have internal processing which can increase latency so you would adjust the video latency to ensure the video is in sync with the audio. This is the only way to guarantee sync</pre>
 ⤷  lukesavvides :  
<pre>Otherwise i guarantee there will be people who have sync issues because of the speaker they use when watching videos and it will cause issues. Having the user adjustment (like 5 simple levels of delay in video) is a way to guarantee you can put the video in sync with every bluetooth speaker on the market</pre>
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Luke: how do you do it on your laptop for eg?</pre>
 ⤷  lukesavvides :  
<pre>Well a laptop no one would typically watch a movie with Bluetooth speakers. However on VLC player you can adjust the video delay to sync with your Bluetooth speaker audio. In the instance of this projector the delay should be applied at the display level so that everything can be in sync with the audio. This would mean creating I small delay in what is being shown on screen so it is in sync. A simple 1-5 levels of adjustment would mean all Bluetooth speakers and headphones would be in sync</pre>
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>VLC is installed in our projector. In any case, the video sync is too complicated to implement. Just for your reference if you want to delay system wide display by 1 second. 1920x1080 pixels times 3 bytes per pixel (24bit color) times 60 pictures per second (60 FPS refresh). That’s 356 MB of memory required + a nice CPU to process all this. Also the graphic card can’t transcode 1080p 60hz video in real-time. It can decode sure but not encode.</pre>
 ⤷  lukesavvides :  
<pre>Yes I understand VLC is on the system but people will of course use Netflix, amazon, youtube etc. The system wide delay only needs to be maximum 250ms, not 1 second. So 5 levels a user can select, 50, 100, 150 etc. And the delay does not need to be transcoded. Its simply delaying between the process of sending the video from the CPU to the DLP chip. So if you activate a delay it just delays sending the process to the DLP chip by that time.</pre>
 ⤷  lukesavvides :  
<pre>This is also something that Texas Instruments can assist with as they could help with the link between the CPU and the DLP chip in adding a delay. I think this feature would make this projector so much better than all others. If you google bluetooth delay you can see its a wide issue so having it as a selling point on your projector would be huge</pre>
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>And where will this video be stored till it’s ready to be sent?</pre>
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Again, Netflix or others are auto compensating it. </pre>
 ⤷  lukesavvides :  
<pre>If it needs memory, at the max 250ms latency, only 89MB or RAM would be needed which is a small amount given it has 2GB. But the system should not need to transcode. It is not the video file you ware watching that is transcoded, it is the delay is between the CPU and the DLP chip. </pre>
 ⤷  lukesavvides :  
<pre>So all the processing the CPU does, before it sends it to the DLP chip, it can send to RAM first with the delay then to the DLP chip. This should not need transcoding as it is a simple delay function in the coding and the memory requirement is very small, only max 15 frame delay</pre>
 ⤷  lukesavvides :  
<pre>Netflix may also auto compensate, but there are many videos we would watch such as from video files on a USB stick, other video apps like plex, youtube etc.  This I think it why you have not seen a sync issue yet because you are using an app that has auto delay. </pre></div></div>

I know you had no experience in crowdfunding and this is more like an experiment, but It seems you are treating this like normal online retailing. The development and feedback handling are honestly great but the whole thing about pricing and free shipping and perks and all the crowdfunding aspects are really badly handled.

Although I know the quality of philips products I am afraid that new projects may have some flaws. If this happens I will have assistance here in Brazil?
The price of the projector is attractive but I will probably pay almost the same amount in import duties so it is important to know if I will be supported if I have any problems.
Thanks!</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">

What would happen if we wanted to project a larger than 120 inch image - Would the 20% increased brightness translate also in a larger than 120 inch maximum image size?

 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Hello Manish, no, there is no bass port, this is a portable projector and the size is pocket friendly. We don't have the size to add sub inside. </pre>

<div id="MTA1">lukesavvides :  
<pre style="margin-left: 50px">I think the latency thing has been overlooked too much by Philips. This is a portable projector so Bluetooth speakers will be used a lot. It’s impossible to test every speaker to see if there is latency but implementing what I mentioned before and adding the ability to delay video to make it in sync will solve the issue and every speaker would be guaranteed to be in sync</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px"></div></div>


<div id="MTA2">Shantanu Tomar :  
<pre style="margin-left: 50px">@ Augusto @ Martin @ A Y  Well thanks for the input. Quite helpful. Really. I wish I had the resources to get my behind the computer. Really, pitiful that I had the audacity to question the campaign handlers for the first product that I am backing. Because, yes, people (my friends / colleagues) working in silicon valley and at Google / Microsoft, when backing electronics in previous crowdfunding campaigns for their families in India were privy the hassles faced at border / custom.</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">
 ⤷  Shantanu Tomar :  
<pre>The landing costs were in some cases equal to the backing contributions. 
People / CAs are still trying to decode the real GST and its layered structure. 
Some products never got delivered because of these hassles at the border. 
I wish it was easy @ A Y but...
#Reallycalm</pre></div></div>


<div id="MTA3">Skanda Shyamsundar :  
<pre style="margin-left: 50px">@AY, what Indian backers are asking for is very simple. It takes one email to the shipping agency who should gladly oblige. Why is this so difficult. A PDF can easily be made by the shippers, who will give the rates in a single page. Many of the times a large customs duty is levied in cash at the times of delivery. These are common issues here. We just want to be prepared that's all.</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Hello, as previously said, we will actively send an email to ALL backers about the shipping company we will use and VAT they will need to pay. We won't post anything here. Thanks for you understanding!</pre></div></div>


<div id="MTA4">Petr Sezemský :  
<pre style="margin-left: 50px">Just wanted to say that I love the product idea and campaign as a whole, wish you a lot of success! :-) 

Only thing it’s too bad you aren’t implementing codecs (e.g. AAC/aptx/aptx low latency/aptx HD) to the bluetooth module as it’s a cheap addition and with these you can ensure the wireless audio quality will be as good as with wired quality, presuming the right conditions are satisfied. I’d even be happy to pay extra for this feature. :-)</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Hello, there are different aptX parameters, some are hardware some or software based. You would be happy to pay extra but what about the 10,000 other people :-). We need to content everyone here. In any case we don't have any issues with latency. Wish you a nice day!</pre></div></div>


<div id="MTA5">Pico Pico :  
<pre style="margin-left: 50px">@Skanda Shyamsundar  if I recall correctly, Philips had informed me the amount declared on the papers would be the exact amount paid by the backer. It would be up to customs to accept or reject that amount, which is out of Philips control.</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Hello, yes indeed.</pre></div></div>


<div id="MTEw">Skanda Shyamsundar :  
<pre style="margin-left: 50px">Again in India, if Phillips is going to use a company like DHL or FEDEX, they will have a very clear and defined process of customs clearance. Not a single high value parcel can enter India without Aadhaar and other info. So these companies will be able to actually exactly tell us what we need to pay. We have no issues paying whatever is due. Just need to know what we are in for, upfront. The reason I'm saying this is that if the papers are not right, we will end up paying IGST of close to 48%!</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px"></div></div>


<div id="MTEx">Skanda Shyamsundar :  
<pre style="margin-left: 50px">My dear sirs from countries other than India, the reasons we are asking for what we have to pay is that in India, sometimes the VAT that is charged is not on the shown value of the device but on what the customs assessors think. This is a very valid and fair request. It does not make sense in our "early backing" and paying a much higher end cost. Unlike some of the "requests" that border on nitpicking, what we are asking for is what we have to be ready for financially. What's wrong with that</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px"></div></div>


<div id="MTEy">VASU ANAND :  
<pre style="margin-left: 50px">@Augusto Echecopar @Martin Meidl  @A Y  People, unlike your countries, the tax structure in India is excruciating.. It might even border the actual cost of the device. So unlike you with fat pockets have to be prepared. I understand you wouldn't really  care to understand, but please do try, We're not hogging down on the campaign owner to include industrial grade tech into a portable projector like a few of you, We're merely asking a little clarity on the tax stuff,</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">
 ⤷  VASU ANAND :  
<pre>Please also consider that we as end users are oblivious to the multiple level tax structure and import duties, BUT the shipping partner might be well informed. An email perhaps might clear the confusion. So all we ask Philips is to give us an estimate or let us know who's handling the shipping and provide a contact so we may ask enquire directly.

<pre>Hello Vasu, we understand your concern but in any case, the cost that we will give you will be un estimation.

<div id="MTE2">Augusto Echecopar :  
<pre style="margin-left: 50px">@Shantanu Tomar, you are just buying a mini projector and not a Car! Relax your ways, you are already borderline with being inappropriate.  Whatever the VAT that corresponds you to pay, you will be paying it, it is the law, not Philips charging for it. And regarding any extra fees, well, that is the risk you assume when buying something from another country, next time I suggest you to source your tech from India to avoid this kind of issues. Obviously your first crowdfunding project. Best luck.</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px"></div></div>

I am no technician so I'm often impressed by all the technical questions asked here. What I want is an easy-to-use/easy-to-travel-with device. Because I intend to take it everywhere with me.

Can you think of designing a real piece of luggage (even if optional) for this material ? Thks !</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">

Thanks!</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">

<pre>Hello! I'm trying to find a single solution for the all recharging. I think nowadays it's insane to have seven different chargers if you can manage with only one. Lot of companies are actually selling products without the charger because the fact that we already have one (or seven) at home and the environmental impact.

So I will try again, what is the watt requirement for the charger to be able to charge and use the projector at the same time? Do you think my Anker will do the job?

<pre style="margin-left: 50px">Is there a possibility you could offer the projector in an alternative colour/finish, like white? I think it would look really smart in white. Also I don't like the glossy finish because it will pick up scratches and fingerprints very easily. A matte finish also makes it look more premium and more rugged especially as it is a portable projector so will be put in bags</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">
 ⤷  lukesavvides :  
<pre>Anyone who agrees post a comment so we can show support for that change. If there many people who feel the same then it makes sense to make the plastics change</pre>
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Hello, unfortunately we won't change the color nor finish. The PicoPix Max is part of the PicoPix Collection which is black. Premium appealing, colors and finish is really tough to choose and everyone can have a different opinion. We made several survey about the color of our product and that's why we chose this one.</pre>
 ⤷  lukesavvides :  
<pre>OK colour i understand, but all of your other picopix projectors are matte plastic which is much much more resistant to scratches and fingerprints. So the choice of the glossy finish doesn't make much sense because it will be scratched very easily. Don't you agree?</pre>
 ⤷  lukesavvides :  
<pre>Actually your picipix range are all different, some matte, some glossy, some white, some black.</pre>
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Hello, not at all, all the PicoPix Nano, Micro and Max have the exact same design language, colors and finish</pre>
 ⤷  lukesavvides :  
<pre>Yes I agree those 3 are the same, but the other picopix products (PicoPix Mobile, PicoPix pocket) are different. I understand the logic of creating a standard design across the range, but given these are portable, they will be put in bags and moved much more often then a normal projector which means they are subject to scratching a fingerprints a lot more. so either the finish should be made more durable, i.e. matte finish, or perhaps release a protective skin for it to protect it. </pre>
 ⤷  lukesavvides :  
<pre>Otherwise if it starts picking up scratches, it makes the Philips branding look bad because other people who see it covered in scratches will be put off buying a philips product because they can see it can be damaged easily.</pre>
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Don't worry there is a 3 layers painting + UV</pre>
 ⤷  lukesavvides :  
<pre>That is no indication of the hardness of the finish. It is the hardness that determines the scratch resistance, not the UV</pre>

<pre style="margin-left: 50px">How does it come that you keep claiming that "ANSI" Lumen is not a standard suitable for led-projectors?  
It´s a measurement method which you can use for EVERY light-emitting projector, laser, bulb and ALSO for led projectors - your "Color-LED-ANSI-Lumen" is just a made up thing which is not based on the standard method for measuring so nobody could compare.
So could you please tell us the Lumen of the projector, measured with the method the "American National Standards Institute" provides ?</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">

<pre>Sebastian, we already explained many times. If you buy 2 different projectors from 2 different brand advertising the same number of Lumens, you will see that the perceived brightness is not the same at all</pre></div></div>

Besides that, really appreciate the hard work! It's so good to see this projector shaping up to be one of the best portable and even main projectors.</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">

Will there be any problems/delay regarding the 50 - 60hz signal diff between Europe and USA broadcasting? “Apple TV” sorted it out by “auto matching”  frame rates when switching from netflix app (60hz) to local streaming tv apps (50hz)

<pre style="margin-left: 50px">⚠️ ? QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THIS CAMPAIGN WORKS ? ⚠️

Hello Philips!

I note a strange phenomenon that I have been observing for the past few days and that deserves clarification from you:
The number of perks varies between 6 and 9 without ever going above or below while the number of backers has increased considerably, is this a strategy to sell as many aircraft as possible in the last few days by putting pressure on the fact that there are not many left where there is a rational explanation?</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">
 ⤷  Samuel Molteni :  
<pre>Because if we’re rational, there shouldn’t be one left now?
Even if several buyers have asked for a refund, it is still unlikely that the number will always fluctuate between 6 and 9 with an increasing number of backers...
</pre>
 ⤷  Samuel Molteni :  
<pre>For example if I record here the evolution we notice (FRENCH HOUR GMT+1)
at 22:23:: 10 569 backers "Only 9 left" (before i buy one)
at 22:39:: 10 570 backers "Only 8 left"
at 22:45:: 10 571 backers "Only 7 left"
at 23:51:: 10,588 backers "Only 8 left"
at 00:13:: 10 594 backers "Only 8 left"
at 00:48:: 10 595 backers "Only 7 left"
at 01:37:: 10 604 backers "Only 7 left"
at 01:45:: 10 605 backers "Only 8 left" (+ "10 days left" message)
at 04:38:: 10 616 backers "Only 8 left"</pre>
 ⤷  Samuel Molteni :  
<pre>In this one loop, it rotates between 9 and 7 continuously. (9,8,7 &gt; 9,8,7 &gt; ...)

Is it an Indiegogo tool that offers you to automatically do ca on your campaign to maximize sales by putting pressure on new visitors?

This is very surprising about a crownfunding campaign, we are entitled to wonder if we can trust you?

I’m not criticizing the projector that looks good, but I have doubts about your sharing with Indiegogo and how your campaign works, and I don’t think I’m the only one.</pre>

 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Hello, we already answered this topic many times. We've always had a particular number of units earmarked for lower price tiers. Because Philips is a worldwide company, based off of the geos we're driving to the page via various email placements, we will add to this number based on our projections. It's only fair that we keep these prices to ensure that our waitlist subscribers in those geos have access. However, one shouldn't assume that these will last forever. Backing now is the only way to l</pre>
 ⤷  Samuel Molteni :  
<pre>Hello,
This does not explain why the number always turns between 9 and 7 (or 6), either you have a defined quantity and you display it (e.g.:200), or you produce infinity and you display a very high maximum number, or that there is no limit.
This is purely a commercial technique on a crownfunding campaign, to make potential buyers believe that there are very few left, whereas in reality, since you’ve posted this very low number of remaining units,</pre>
 ⤷  Samuel Molteni :  
<pre>he sold hundreds of them (which doesn’t match your explanation).

Not very honest all that.

I don’t see how every hour someone from Philips can be behind his screen adding 2 more projectors in the availabilities to always adjust between 9 and 6 remaining units.
Your answer is not convincing on that point.</pre></div></div>

@Philips...are you sure this will work? In fact, can you guarantee this? Do you fully understand Giorgio Zoja's original question below?

If you are confident about this, then it's a feasible solution for outputting a digital audio signal - at the very least digital stereo audio. In fact, there's no need for optical or arc in this scenario.

<pre style="margin-left: 50px">Hey Team PicoPix! Fantastic update! I have a few questions though:
1 Can MEMC be disabled? While it’s great for gaming and live sports, the soap opera effect is horrible for movies.
2 Regarding ARC, it’s not gonna happen, right? Anyway, it would make a great feature for the next gen.</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">

<pre>3 Would you try connecting a Creative Super X-fi amp? It’s  usb-c headphone dac/amp for android that can take stereo, 5.1 or 7..1 audio and  “binauralise” it for headphones. As it’s not bigger than a usb stick, it’d be the perfect match to the PicoPix Max.</pre>

<pre style="margin-left: 50px">This is so disappointing to hear at shipment time that there is a one-month delay. you had to know in advance of course that the delay was going to happen and this is just a trick from you to announce new functionalities in order to justify this.

<pre style="margin-left: 50px">Comment on Update 7:
This update is fantastic.
I'd like to mention to the great development team that I'm happy to wait the right time, for example 1-2 months more, if they are willing to work on finalising this amazing product and adding, refining or shaping better some more features

For the rest of the people here, would you also agree on this? I think they are working hard and that'll benefit the product we'll get, and who cares if it's just 10 films ahead of November? :)

Thanks !</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">
 ⤷  Marco Sartiano :  
<pre>My personal interests on update would be (in order of importance):
- A great Audio system for what the size allows - Why is this important? Because I'd like to avoid buying a bluetooth set that needs pairing, attentione, recharge, etc - For example Nebula 2 has a more than acceptable audio, could you compare? - better if 3D/360°
- Less HDMI latency if obtainable
- Great importance in reducing bluetooth latency (Imagine playing precise games, for example rhythm games, and being 200ms ahead)
- bag</pre>
 ⤷  Marco Sartiano :  
<pre>As the comment didn't show up correctly, just to recap: 1. better audio, so that it's satisfying enough for casual audience (very important) 2. HDMI latency reduction 3. Bluetooth Latency reduction 4. if possible, a carrying bag would be nice, being natively a portable solutions - - - - Feel free, users, to add your thoughts</pre></div></div>

4- please let us turn off MEMC, and I agree a night mode would be a nice software addition : yes, image will not be great in that mode, but that's not the point.

<pre style="margin-left: 50px">@ carljohan selke When import something from another country, you need to pay import duties &amp; taxes, and sometimes, admin fees. In our case, we need to pay extra VAT (which is tax). Technically, things from another EU country do not subject to duties (0-20%); however, it's so rare that the price of the product bought in EU does not contain VAT, so I'm also not sure whether paying duty is required or not. Last but not least, not sure whether there is admin fees in Sweden.</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">
 ⤷  marvelous.islander :

<div id="NTE4">VASU ANAND :  
<pre style="margin-left: 50px">Thoroughly disappointed with the update. 
I cannot by any means accept any delay in shipping.  

We signed up in August hoping to get our hands on the device by October. 

These upgrades DO NOT matter to the majority of the people who signed up and supported the campaign in August. 
We did not ask for all this. It's a breach of trust.

I wish Philips would stick to their schedule and deliver what they promised. 
If the unexpected demand is the reason you can't meet the schedule pls tell us that.</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Hello Vasu, we are sorry about your feeling, as you can see, many backers were asking for those features, In any case you will receive the PicoPix Max, upgraded! </pre>
 ⤷  VASU ANAND :  
<pre>I hope I do. 

As Mr.Erman Akkaya has said in a comment, we'll wait a couple of weeks more for a trouble-free ,upgraded, future ready product.

And especially since you're so close to 10000% of your goal, it's fair that you take some time to make history. 

Philips, don't break our hearts. 

No more extending the delivery please. Please keep this schedule. </pre></div></div>

<pre style="margin-left: 50px">First of all thanks to Phillips team for the great update. Really excited for 2 key features i.e BT 5.0 upgrade and increased brightness with reduced fan noise. 
Honestly the 15-20 day delay is not a fine considering addition of those features listed. My only concern is you keep on extending the program beyond the end date (now by 10 days) Clearly this is because of all publicity you are getting all over. You are almost at 10000 % over your estimated goal.</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">

<pre>Will the USB-C charging to smart devices be applicable always or only when the projector is connected to external power source?

I want to thank your team for being very active and transparent with all your replies and updates. I've backed a few campaigns where communication was very minimal which wasn't a great experience.

I have 1 question. How many Watts does the power charger adaptor output at? Is it 65W like you recommend for external power banks to charge and power the unit?

Thank you very much.</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">

 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Hey Amanda you have 2 solutions:
- any powerbank will charge the battery
- but you will need a 65watts powerbank to be able to charge and maintain the projector on.
With the solution 1, your powerbank will still charge the PicoPix Max battery, but the built-in battery will power the projector. In the solution 2, the powerbank will charge AND power the projector</pre>

 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Hello, 
Charging can be done with any charger and any voltage as the USB-C will ask the power support to the charger. But if you use a charger that is lower than 67watts, the battery will still charge, slowly and the battery will keep deliver power to the projector. The other solution is to shut down the projector, and charge the battery with any powerbank or charger.</pre></div></div>

<pre style="margin-left: 50px">Dear Philips and fellow backers,
You (Philips) stated multiple times that there is no delay when using BT speakers. How is this possible? In my understanding, there is always a delay with BT speakers, even the better codecs like the AptX LL have a (small) delay. What happens if I use older BT speakers like JBL Extreme (BT4.1/SBC)? The latency with these is usually 150 - 225ms and that's not suitable for Netflix etc. If I stereo pair, it gets even worse. Could the OS include a delay compensation?</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">

<div id="Nzcx">lukesavvides :  
<pre style="margin-left: 50px">What is the ANSI lumens of this projector? NOT the colour ANSI, the proper ANSI</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Hello, 800. Cheers!</pre>
 ⤷  lukesavvides :  
<pre>No this is 800 colour ANSI lumens which is different to normal ANSI lumens. I want to know what is the normal ANSI lumens?</pre>
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Unfortunately, the rule that ANSI Lumens are a universal measurement of brightness for projectors is simply not the case. ANSI Lumens refers to the measurement of determining the brightness of white pixels and was adapted for lamp based projectors. Current projector technology like LED projectors with RGB-B have better color saturation and appear brighter than lamp based projectors. </pre>
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>With the evolution of both the content that we watch and the projectors themselves, standard ANSI Lumens are now obsolete. 
We compared a dozen of projectors advertising 1000 "ANSI LUMENS" and found out that the visible brightness was not the same. A precise measurement shown that the difference between advertised ANSI and the reality was, in some cases more than 54%.</pre>
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>We are using the term Color Lumens which better describes how bright the image will actually look. Essentially, Color Lumens = Lumens + Vivid Color + Fine Tuned Picture Settings. So 800.</pre>
 ⤷  lukesavvides :  
<pre>In this case, do you have a figure for the brightness of the white pixels so we can compare to lamp based projectors? It gives a better comparison than 'Color Lumens' because noone else in the industry uses this. Thanks</pre>
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Hello, we don't give such data, we only communicate on the Lumens which is the industry standard. 800 lumens would be comparable to 800 lumens.</pre>
 ⤷  lukesavvides :  
<pre>OK thanks, I hope it is comparable to 800 ansi lumens of white pixels!!</pre>

Glad to see that!
So, please, take a a particulary care about color deviation.
In past PicoPix, the DeltaE was bad at 11 !(several Pro reviewer note that, like "Les Numériques" in France).
Here, the Red an Green seem over- saturated, is it a particular setting like "vivid" or the main setting?
Please try to have  good calibrated natural colors direct out of the box, it's very important for a projector, and after, the possibility in settings to slightly adjust them...

Audiodelay shouldn't be the function: you'd need Videodelay. That would make it possible to sync with an audiodelay caused at the receiving Bluetooth adapter.
But I don't know if every Video app, like MX or VLC would support that. Good development idea though.</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Klass, you are right, MX and VLC an do this</pre>
 ⤷  Klaas Jan de Vries :  
<pre>But apps like Netflix, YouTube, Disney+, Prime etc don't, I think. So it would be nice if PPX Max (if need) could also make all video output delay. </pre>

<pre>Hello Klaas, for the moment we don't have any delay so we won't implement it. We have tested 10 different brand speakers and 3 differents apps. No lag.</pre>

Why are you comparing a price excl tax €439 with a price incl tax €899  is isn't legal ??

Just wondering whether the Youtube app on Aptoide store will allow me to log into my account? Just concerned that I have my playlists saved in my account and want to be sure they are accessible.</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">

<pre>Hello, we will test this today</pre></div></div>


<div id="ODE0">Nitin Sharma :  
<pre style="margin-left: 50px">So if I have understood correctly, the product has chrome cast, airplay and Miracast for wireless projection,  usb c and HMDI ports for wired connection, 3.5 mm jack and Bluetooth for audio, and USB B and micro SD card functionality for external storage. This sounds like a good portable projector.</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px"></div></div>


<div id="ODE1">Joao Manoel Barbosa Pereira :  
<pre style="margin-left: 50px">I vote for HDMI ARC, even if this will take more time to get the projector.
I know that some people wants the projector as soon as possible (I also want), but this feature will make our projector much more versatile. For people that just want the mobility this won't make difference, but for people that wants a better audio this will be excelent. Most of us don't have a cinema projector at home, and the picopix is showing a very good entry level projector.</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">
 ⤷  Joao Manoel Barbosa Pereira :  
<pre>If the projector receives ARC, for sure it will be the best portable projector in the market right now, with all the connections that a normal/experienced user needs.</pre></div></div>

15 hours ago they said “ Great news! We have received the PicoPix Max packaging and we will get some shots tonight along with the video showing Youtube, APTOIDE store and Netflix.”
After doing that it takes time to edit, pass internal reviews, then post.  So it could easily be another day or so to actually see the video.</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">

<pre>Or even two or three days.  
This is from decades of product development and engineering experience, and these days with the instant and explosive atmosphere of the internet I’d be careful to shoot video and post to minimise the many dangers of getting inaccurate footage due to shutter angle, frame rate, and scan speed interacting with a video projector picture which is then converted by Indiegogo, YouTube, Facebook to be displayed on a huge range of different mobile phones, tablets, computers.</pre>

<pre style="margin-left: 50px">Also my vote is is that ARC is not relevant to me.  My use cases are for camping, travelling, for watching in the bedroom where we have no TV and for watching outside on our balcony.  For audio, I will use internal speakers, Bluetooth headphones (especially now I can use two! Thanks!) or Bluetooth speakers.  Connecting to a 5.1 system is much better served by a non-portable projector.</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px"></div></div>

Arc has is not paramout in a portable pico projector, even on the business side if you use it for presentation.
First if you use it that mean there is no tv or videoprojector in the room.
Second since there isnt a videoprojector i don't think they will be a arc soundsystem</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px"></div></div>

I've owned many portable projectors, I've yet to see one lasting more than 5 years, from respectable brands or not, even if LED are advertised as 30 years.
They never last 30 years, even in big projectors.
They NEVER last long in such small products, mainly because of the heat generated.</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px"></div></div>

Thank you for your efforts! A few questions:
1. Are you still implementing Widevine L1? Is there this possibility that you don't manage to implement it? 
2. About the noise, I am excited about your video that you are going to upload soon, but still some measurements and numbers would be great. 
3. I know that we can cast video/audio via Chromecast or Airplay on the device, but is this possible to cast the sound from the device to a speaker, using google home app and via WiFi? 
Best</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Hello!
1: Yes!
2: numbers are coming!
3: we didn't test this function, we will try tomorrow.</pre></div></div>


<div id="ODk4">Will Plaister :  
<pre style="margin-left: 50px">Is ARC a physical change or a protocol? Maybe the pcba already supports arc as it's hdmi 1.4 compliant. Software update perhaps? 
Also, just read somewhere that ARC can't decode HD formats like dts master, dolby HD, dts x or dolby atmos. In this sense, it's the exactly the same as optical which is only capable of the old dolby and dts formats. eArc on the other hand...:P
Some form of digital output aside from BT is good for future-proofing. Who knows how we'll connect picopix in the future!?</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px"></div></div>


<div id="ODk5">Will Plaister :  
<pre style="margin-left: 50px">@ Matthew Rose. I've owned a few Yamaha receivers over the journey too, they just don't die! Haha!
So I quickly checked and the RXV367 does support arc so IF they include this feature you'd get 5.1 surround from any source (apple tv, bluray, set top box) and you'd also get 5.1 surround from any app that supports and outputs dts/dolby etc. - Netflix, Plex, Kodi, VLC, sports apps and so on :)

Cheers,

<div id="OTQ1">Will Plaister :  
<pre style="margin-left: 50px">@Matthew Rose. I dunno, I personally wouldn't connect directly the bd player to the projector as Philips have recommended below. I would connect your sources (bluray, Apple TV etc.) directly to the Yamaha AVR. Then 'hdmi out' to the projector. Some AVRs have dual hdmi outputs so you could connect 1 to TV and 1 to the picopix max without having to manually change hdmi cables when you switch between tv/projctor. As far as I know the audio delay would be minute. Philips say delay is 30ms on hdmi.</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">
 ⤷  Will Plaister :  
<pre>Also, what's your Yamaha model number?
By connecting all your sources directly to an AVR you ensure IT takes care of the HD audio decoding (5.1/7.1/Atmos etc.) and simply 'passes' the video through to the TV or projector.
Make sense?</pre></div></div>

<pre>From what I have been able to verify, Philips makes use of JmGO hardware (Screeneo S6 = JmGO X3), Philips basically modifies the firmware according to its "needs". Screeneo costs about $ 1799, JmGO about $ 1100.
What I mean and I am fearing is that I will receive a projector, supposedly Philips that is actually from a Chinese manufacturer and a month is € 200 cheaper on Aliexpress.
That if Screeneo S6 indicates 2000 color lumens, Jmgo X3 indicates 1500 ANSI lumens, it does not seem so complicate</pre>

"Pixel array size is 1368 columns by 768 rows in a square grid pixel arrangement.

 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Unfortunately, the rule that ANSI Lumens are a universal measurement of brightness for projectors is simply not the case.

Current projector technology like LED projectors with RGB-B have better color saturation and appear brighter than lamp based projectors. </pre>
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>With the evolution of both the content that we watch and the projectors themselves, standard ANSI Lumens are now obsolete. 
We compared a dozen of projectors advertising 1000 "ANSI LUMENS" and found out that the visible brightness was not the same. A precise measurement shown that the difference between advertised ANSI and the reality was, in some cases more than 54%.</pre>

<pre style="margin-left: 50px">You stated that we can return it during 30 days after receiving.
Will you also refund VAT then ? I ask since this is not a pre-sale but a "partnership" to get around law.

I also ask, because the video provided shows massive sync problem while BT is not in use (how come is that even possible, I wonder), and a really loud fan noise. 
Your assertion of 27dB @1m (is this dBA SPL ?) also seems way too low to be credible.

Hope you guys can provide a better demo experience before campaign ends !</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Hello Nicolas,
1: we are not collecting the Vat but the shipping company does it, you will need to ask them the vat back 
2: we have 23db on have Screeneo U3, so everything is possible :) </pre>
 ⤷  LEGRET Nicolas :  
<pre>Ok, so VAT is lost in case of refund, thanks for clarifying that !

Screeneo U3 is huge compared to picopix max, so it may be possible using a largely wider case ;)
anyway, it's advertised at 25dB and measured by reviewers around 32dB (@ full brightness).
That number seems a lot more realistic, since most room's ambient noise can be measured around 28/30dB ;)</pre>
 ⤷  LEGRET Nicolas :  
<pre>Well, I know I won't get realistic values for noise level, brightness, and contrast ratio, this is common practice in the display industry, unfortunately.
We'll need to wait for reviews to see the real numbers, but campaign ends in 15 days and I doubt we'll get independent reviews before that date.

Too bad, just have to take the bet I guess !
Hope you can make it real quieter =)</pre></div></div>

File managers can be installed and used as servers on both andriod and pc/macbook. If the OS doesnt have something built in already, youll be able to install a simple app on the store to make that possible.
and for your forth question, android natively supports keyboard and mouse
Netflix offline should absolutely work.

though hopefully support can help.</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px"></div></div>

<div id="MTEyOQ==">Thomas Hill :  
<pre style="margin-left: 50px">In addition to higher perceived brightness, projectors with LED also tend to have higher luminous efficiency, higher perceived light output, wider colour gamut, and stunning image quality. 

Clearly, with the "Color Lumens = Lumens + Vivid Color + Fine Tuned Picture Settings", this means the standard "ANSI Lumens" may be less than 800, but the overall viewing quality will be better than what you might think of say "600 ANSI Lumens". Why would Philips undersell using an outdated standard.</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px"></div></div>


<div id="MTEzMA==">Ludovic LE GAL :  
<pre style="margin-left: 50px">About the discussion "ANSI Lumens" vs "Color Lumens", everybody can have a look at this page (from Viewsonic, a competitor of Philips ;-) ) which explains very well the difference of perception you have with a DLP projector :
https://www.viewsonic.com/de/products/projectors/lumens/
Instead of "Color Lumens", they use the term of "LCD Lumens", but it's the very same discussion.
It gives keys to understand the subject and (maybe ?) close the topic...</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Ludovic, each and every brand has its own way. We do not rely on our competition and the statement we made several time here is pretty straight forward :)</pre>

<pre>I understand why you say you don't rely on competitors...
Nevertheless, for those who need a visual explanation, the view "Same measured brightness" / "Same perceived brightness" and, more, the parallel pictures of 2200 ANSI Lumens lamp projector and 900 ANSI Lumens LED projector are very pertinent to explain what you mean when you say "Lumens + Vivid Color + Fine Tuned Picture Settings".</pre>

<pre style="margin-left: 50px">I´m not happy what you answer to Alex S and I repeat question nr 2: 2. What is the closest : regular“ANSI lumens” equivalent of 800 “ANSI color”lumens you quote for this device?
“Color lumen” is some new term you introduce which is different metric from “industry standard”, which is ‘ANSI lumens’. ‘ANSI lumens’ is metric quoted by most manufacturers including Texas Instruments, who provide chips for the whole industry.

Answer to question nr. 1 are perhaps 45w ??</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Hello Riku, Unfortunately, the rule that ANSI Lumens are a universal measurement of brightness for projectors is simply not the case. ANSI Lumens refers to the measurement of determining the brightness of white pixels and was adapted for lamp based projectors. Current projector technology like LED projectors with RGB-B have better color saturation and appear brighter than lamp based projectors.
</pre>
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>With the evolution of both the content that we watch and the projectors themselves, standard ANSI Lumens are now obsolete. 
We compared a dozen of projectors advertising 1000 "ANSI LUMENS" and found out that the visible brightness was not the same. A precise measurement shown that the difference between advertised ANSI and the reality was, in some cases more than 54%.</pre>
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>We are using the term Color Lumens which better describes how bright the image will actually look. Essentially, Color Lumens = Lumens + Vivid Color + Fine Tuned Picture Settings</pre>
 ⤷  Riku Verkkomäki :  
<pre>Dear Philips, If there are no comparable numerical values, we would love to see the video in different conditions (bright light and dim lights) as well as products with comparable brightness, such as to the XGIMI Z6 Polar. And yes, yes I know the product is not comparable, but we know how bright it is and that is what interests us. Thanks!</pre>

<pre style="margin-left: 50px">@Seyedamirhosein Motamedi: I'm afraid those 14-days withdrawal rights only apply if an EU customer buys from an EU seller. But in this case, the seller is not in the EU. You don't get such a withdrawal right when you buy from Aliexpress either, for example. This has nothing to do with VAT.
VAT is collected by the delivery service and transferred to the fiscal authorities of the country where you live; Philips has nothing to do with this at all.</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px"></div></div>

Regardless of who collects the VAT (you or the courier), when I pay the VAT, at least here in Germany, it means that I am purchasing the product and therefore I am covered by the withdrawal rights, which means that I can send back the product within 14 days of the receiving date without any reason given. Is this the same for this product or you are not going to accept any returns?

It was discussed below, but answer is not very clear to me. i.e. how does this projector compare to other projectors from legitimate manufacturers (I.e. Viewsonic, Optoma, Epson, BenQ, etc) in terms of brightness? I.e. does it mean that your projector is 4 times brighter than another manufacturer’s 200 ANSI lumens dlp Pico projector? Or ‘color lumens’ is marketing and output will be comparable? For me brightness and resolution are among 2 key decisive factors.</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">

<pre>Small addition: I’m not a tech person. Please help me understand what brightness I can expect from this device. I’m also trying to understand how this model stacks agains similar models from other leading manufacturers?

Is there a direct ‘lumens only’ value for this device (excluding color/setting), just light output?</pre>

 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Hello, we have already closed this topic :-). </pre>
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Unfortunately, the rule that ANSI Lumens are a universal measurement of brightness for projectors is simply not the case. ANSI Lumens refers to the measurement of determining the brightness of white pixels and was adapted for lamp based projectors. Current projector technology like LED projectors with RGB-B have better color saturation and appear brighter than lamp based projectors. </pre>
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>With the evolution of both the content that we watch and the projectors themselves, standard ANSI Lumens are now obsolete. 
We compared a dozen of projectors advertising 1000 "ANSI LUMENS" and found out that the visible brightness was not the same. A precise measurement shown that the difference between advertised ANSI and the reality was, in some cases more than 54%. We are using the term Color Lumens which better describes how bright the image will actually look. </pre>
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Essentially, Color Lumens = Lumens + Vivid Color + Fine Tuned Picture Settings."</pre></div></div>

We will see after Philips' measuring, but for me the best response is that the size of the image is not 250" but 150", which needs to be displayed the exact distance you announced : 4 meters (157,5" with the 1.05 ratio).
For a 250" image in 16:9, you need a wall 3,55m high and 6,35m wide ...</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Ludovic, thanks for pointing out this error, it's indeed 261" distance from the wall to get 250" diagonal display. We were so excited to show this massive image that we didnt realize the distance. In any case, we do not recommend to get this big size but to stay under 120" to get the best contrast and colors. Thanks!</pre>
 ⤷  Ludovic LE GAL :  
<pre>No problem, guys ;-)
But you should update the Update #4, which mentions this false size.</pre>
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Ludovic, the size is fine, 250" is ok. We didn't talk about the distance to the wall</pre></div></div>

<div id="MTIxMA==">El Mehdi Asselman :  
<pre style="margin-left: 50px">You said: “To get an image of 250” we placed the projector at around 3.5meters away."
Ludovic coorected this by pointing out that there is a 1.05 ratio between diagonal and distance (or 1.2 between width and distance) and the distance should be 6.65m
You responded that there is a formula... 
Light travels in a straight line once out of the projector. The relation is linear so it should be 6.65m
The only change is the different focus, that could zoom a little but not that much. 
Please clarify.</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">

<pre style="margin-left: 50px">Referring to your answer to Marco Müller ― He was asking for projection TO the ceiling, not FROM the ceiling. I think you confused these two cases several times in other answers, too.
So, to rephrase the question: Will the included tripod be able to hold the PPMax at 90 degrees, so you can project TO the ceiling FROM BELOW (i.e. straight up)? Or will we have to buy a special tripod for that case?</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">

<pre style="margin-left: 50px">You've responded to Skanda Shyamsundar that "To get an image of 250" we placed the projector at around 3.5meters away."
According to the abacus in your Story page, I think it's more like 6.65 meters, no ?</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Hello, no we didn't really measure but the room was even less than 6m long and we were pretty close to the wall. We will measure again tonight. It was between 3.5 and 4m</pre>
 ⤷  Ludovic LE GAL :  
<pre>Hum... I do not understand the reasoning. We see on your infographic that we get an image of 80" at a projection distance of 84", 100" at 105" and 120" at 126". So we have a factor of 1.05 between the size of the image and the distance of projection. So, as the zoom does not go beyond 100% (i.e. it can't upscale the image), for the 250" we should be at 262", or 6.65m... By this calculation, at 3.5m the image would be 3.33m, that is to say 131".</pre>
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Ludovic this is not how you calculate. There is an equation between the throw ratio, the brightness, the diagonal size... So we will measure again tonight about those 250" to be sure</pre>

<pre>OK, thanks.</pre></div></div>

How many amps I can drain from the USB-C video connector while using the projector? 5V@2A????</pre>
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>You will need 45 watts. and the USB-C video cannot deliver power. You will need 1 charger for your device and 1 for the projector. Otherwise if your device has 2 USB-C, you can charge the PicoPix Max with your device but you device needs to be connected to a power adapter.</pre>
 ⤷  Joao Manoel Barbosa Pereira :  
<pre>ok Philips thank you for your reply. In the specification of the projector is mentioned that the projector has a powerbank function, so this would be only in the type A USB connector, I suspect. Can I drain 5V@2A from there and still use the projector? I think maybe you could rewrite the sentence on the page "The USB Type-C ports deliver fast data, audio, video and quick charging!" to not confuse the reader, since the USB-C cannot charge the user device.</pre>

I have a question regarding the return policy of the projector.

 -Is there a chance we'll get Play Store even just via an OTA? 
 -Do you think it'll work with air mouse remotes with dongle?
 -Is it possible to charge via powerbank?
 - How long is the charging time?
 -Does bluteooth sound output still work even when using HDMI? (all my pico projectors don't)
 -How is the storage partitioned? 16GB will be fully available for installing apps?

Thanks. I'm very excited. Hopefully, this is a great upgrade from my Laser Beam Pro.</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Hello Nick, 
1: Maybe but we need to check with Google, they never certify projectors...
2: our remote is already an AirMote :-)
3: yes, with 45watts
4: 2.5hours around, but still tuning it
5: we will test and get back to you
6: 16GB is for the entire system with apps, you still have the opportunity to install plenty of apps don't worry, otherwise you will need to insert a MicroSD to get a larger storage. Thanks!</pre>
 ⤷  Nick Luigi Eusebio :  
<pre>Thank you very much for the reply.
It's cool that the included remote is already an airmote but I already have a good one with a keyboard (with backlit) so I don't want to just put it in the drawer ;)

As for the storage, I am interested because all my pico projectors had this problem where apps partition is only 2 GB so it's very limited and frustrating.

And lastly, hopefully the test on the bluetooth audio output is positive because it'll be good when connecting consoles.</pre>
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Hello, if you have another Bluetooth remote, it will work as well but it needs to be HID protocol. For Storage, 3 GB or less will be allocated to the OS.</pre></div></div>

Now it has changed to the end of october...

Also you said that you will send it as a gift (that is normal) so without VAT to pay and now you have changed mind and i will have to pay VAT which is 80€ more!!!

What are you going to change next?
It isn't fair</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Hello Frank, we always answered to all backers that the shipping date will be at the end of Oct. The FAQ wasnt updated.

 ⤷  Franck Rosenstein :  
<pre>Hi,
In the FAQ it was written "at the end of september" .
And no it isn't illegal to send a free copy of a product to investors.

If i'm an investor on your project, i can wait the product to be finished (until end of october) and receive a free copy!!!
If i just buy the product, i'm ok to pay the VAT but respect the deadline you've put on your FAQ!
As you may know, In France it is Illegal to send a product at a price which isn't include the VAT to the end user!</pre>
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Hello Frank, I;m sorry but we won't debate again on this. This topic was closed some weeks ago. The VAT will be collected by the shipping company and we always answered that the shipping will be at the end of Oct. Have a great day!</pre>

<pre>So what you do is illegal!</pre>
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Not at all. All product on Indiegogo are sold without VAT. The VAT is not collected via Indiegogo nor us, but when the country enters inside your country. So the SHipping company will collect it to be in line with the local regulations. </pre>

Sometimes we lose money because society can not achieve the product and sometime we make a good deal (like all the investment are) 
But i've never paid VAT here!!! There is no sence!</pre>

<pre>Dear Frank, if you are not satisfied with the product or with the services, you can certainly ask for a refund. Wish you a great day!</pre>
 ⤷  Franck Rosenstein :  
<pre>I didn't said that i'm not satisfied with the product.
But in fact u use indiegogo to sell product and no to finance it.
Every day we can see that there is xx products left and after few hours there is more product left...
You are  cheating with us!</pre></div></div>

With the system being Android, do you think it may be possible to get an auto rotate feature similar to the announced, Acer C250i. Auto-rotate between horizontal and vertical positioning of the device.

Talking about rotating the device, the air cooling vents is it from both left and right sides, or just one of the sides?

fyi, the new pics look great!</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Roberto, rotating the image can be done from the menu in 5seconds top :-) No need to add extra cost and make a key selling point of something automatic ! Yes cooled on sides </pre></div></div>

<pre style="margin-left: 50px">Hi @Phillips,

For shipping to Canada from the U.S. you mentioned maybe using DHL, as noted by James C and Johannes The, couriers like UPS and DHL are the worst when it comes to the brokerage fees that they add on top of any customs charges. FedEx is only slightly better.

I would also like to vote for USA-&gt;Canada shipping to use express shipping via US Post (which will then transfer Canada Post).

Thanks very much for update 4, really looking forward to my PicoPix Max!!</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">

<pre style="margin-left: 50px">Hi there,
In update 4 you show some pictures of it projecting at 250". I know you advertise the product as maximum 120", on bigger sizes the image quality will degrade and that is perfectly understandable. But can you focus/overrule the autofocus to project bigger than 120"? Or is it still focused for 120" thus giving a soft 250" picture (I mean focus, not due to increased pixel size). Having an even larger image, while being of lesser quality, might come in handy now and then. 
Thanks!</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Hello Reinier, if you want bigger than 120" you will need more distance with the wall. The autofocus will still work but we suggest to use it only in a dark room at that size. Cheers!</pre>

<pre style="margin-left: 50px">So let me repeat the pros and cons :
Pros:
1080p pico projector.
800 COLOR lumens (lumens you just created and can't compare to others btw).

Cons:
-Bad speakers (too weak to watch a movie in good conditions...think about it: eyes at 1080p, ears at 2x4w? So an external bluetooth speaker becomes mandatory).
-Fan noise (?)
-No way to cast content AND do multitasking for chrome/android users (that's smart tv from 2014).

Also, 3hours battery life was for 600 lumens, how much with 800 lumens?

<pre>Hello HB. As we say in french, the most beautiful girl/man can only offers what it has. If our PicoPix Max doesn't fit your expectation we are really sorry about this.

Battery life at 800 lumens? Why no smart cast function allowing multitasking for Android/Chrome users (that's software so still manageable I guess)? Cheers</pre>
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Hello HB, the multitasking is possible on both Android and Airplay. We also support cast button so you are able to do something else on your phone. We tried is tonight. For the battery life at 800, we are still testing. Have a great evening</pre>
 ⤷  H B :  
<pre>Thanks for the reply. That's great news, but Android is an OS and Airplay a protocol, so I am not sure why you compare them? What protocole do you use to cast that allow multitasking for Android/chrome devices if not chromecast?

While the Philips perk is amazing value, the MSRP of $993 seems a little too much compared to the $489 of the C250i, given that Acer is also a reputable brand.
Considering that both the products are at IFA Berlin, a comparison would be great, it might be a big ask but given the lack of any standard brightness measurements, this is probably the only reasonable way to compare them.</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">

<pre>I guess this does not answer my question, Its better to put a protective layer or scratch resistance on the lens or the outer glass protecting the lens. This way we can be confident and relieved that the lens or the outer glass will not be scratched. I am sure you are giving a 2 year warranty and such things will be taken care. However its ideal to prevent than to cure is it?</pre></div></div>


<div id="MTQ1Mw==">Aravind Chandrasekaran :  
<pre style="margin-left: 50px">I just joined as a backer to this campaign by getting a perk. However I have faced the following practical issues while using projects so far in my experience...</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">
 ⤷  Aravind Chandrasekaran :  
<pre>1. The lens gets scratched over a period of time: This happens while cleaning the lens and despite taking good care caution. Sometimes even a cloud of moisture forms inside the lens which is really hard to clean. All of this will affect the projection quality and will project an image which is not as clear as when the projector was newly purchased. How will PicoPix Max address this issue? Is there a scratch proof glass or lens that covers the actual lens as a protective layer?</pre>
 ⤷  Aravind Chandrasekaran :  
<pre>2. Sometimes the video being played will have a poor audio quality or would not be audible enough. While we do have video players like VLC which solves such problems by increasing the volume upto 200%. And sometime we have sound driver/ firmware which has the feature of increasing the playback volume to 200%. Would PicoPix Max have such an option to amplify the volume to 200% or more which would be a life saver for many.</pre>
 ⤷  Aravind Chandrasekaran :  
<pre>3. Clashing of the Bluetooth output with Video streaming: Most of the time when a video is being streamed from a device to the projector wireless (Windows Wireless Projection, Android Cast, Etc) and the device is connected to a Bluetooth device for audio output. 99.9% of the times the device struggles to stream the video and would be unable to manage both the Bluetooth audio and the wireless video streaming in parallel. How does PicoPix Max address this issue? </pre>
 ⤷  Aravind Chandrasekaran :  
<pre>4. Interoperability between devices: Most of the projectors support wireless streaming or casting from the device to the projector. However the wireless streaming option would mostly be for Windows device or Android device, and would require an additional device such as Apple TV or Airplay to be connected to the projector in order to stream/cast content from apple devices such as iPhones, Macbooks, Etc. Does this projecto have an inbuilt facility to do airplay without the need for any additions.</pre></div></div>

<div id="MTQ3NQ==">David Liew :  
<pre style="margin-left: 50px">I think this could be a great product, but seriously Philips estimated retail price of $999 is definitely way overpriced. LG PF50KA retails for only $650 and is only behind by 200 lumens and softer speakers. However they provide 2 HDMI with 1 being ARC compliant, an Antenna port and also contrast ratio of 100,000:1
I don't see PicoPix Max being worth more than $700 if comparing to the current market offerings which makes this more like a 30% off instead. But it is still a good deal mind you.</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px"></div></div>

<div id="MTQ4Mg==">Robin Boh :  
<pre style="margin-left: 50px">Let's face it guys. It's Philips. 
The answers are always the same. 
Not sure if I have the full list. 
1. No plans for stretch goals / perks.
2. No changes to hardware, just minor improvements to fan noise, what else? 
3.No Android TV since this is custom Android OS. So dont think of built in Chromecast. 
4.Want extra space? Use MicroSD card instead.
5.Want better casing? Sorry. It means adding more costs.
6. How is 800 ANSI color lumens compared with the rest? We are all waiting for reviews.</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">
 ⤷  Robin Boh :  
<pre>Note: For the amount of money they have collected, it will be easier for them to reward the backers. But it is not happening here 
</pre>
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Hello Robin, I remind you that the amount of money is due to the fact that 5214 backers joined us. The margin are very low and we offer the shipping.
We changed already the hardware by adding BT5, battery bypass, Widevine L1... 
Concerning Android TV, we explained since the beginning that Android TV is now our priority as many backers prefer to get Android OS. Furthermore, we need a special hardware for Android TV. 
Extra Space on ROM means bigger price, and extra tax in Europe </pre>
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Casing: yes it's a cost, if you go to a restaurant and ask extra topping on your pizza you will need to pay for it. As the discount is already very high, we don't have space to add more things. We really want to get the best for you but at one point it is not feasible. 
Concerning the 800 lumens, reviews will come as soon as we ship the samples to the Press. 
Hope this is clear, don't hesitate to come back to us if you have any other questions. Have a great day!</pre>

<pre style="margin-left: 50px">I've been following the comments and your answers for a few days, and it seems that you are pretty confident about everything but one. You say that your color ansi lumens was calculated differently than other projectors, but you still compare yours with them. So what is the truth here? Is your brightness measure comparable with others? If yes, why you named it differently? If no, then how to convert it in a way that it gets comparable with other projectors in the market. Thanks!</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Hello Seyedamirhosein.
I think the answer is clear: 1000 lumens on A brand is different from 1000 lumens on B brand. If you buy 2 different product advertising the same lumens, you will see a big difference of brightness. So in order for our customer to get the idea of the amount of lumens, we measured our PicoPix Max and compared with other devices. If we compare to our PicoPix Pro, its much more bright and if we compare to other devices advertising 800 lumens, we are on the same level. Cheers!</pre>

<div id="MTQ4NA==">Jan Steinbach :  
<pre style="margin-left: 50px">The Idea to add an hard-case as an *optional* perk ist good because the existing perk pricepoint for the projector is already very very fair!

 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Hello Jan, yes we will check this internally. Concerning the demo, we will try to show it to you guys but you need to know that for the moment only 3 LEDs are working, not 4 so the brightness wont be 100%. We are still testing and aligning colors/contrast and brightness.</pre></div></div>


<div id="MTQ4NQ==">Trex :  
<pre style="margin-left: 50px">According to epson, color lumen vs white lumen - the actual brightness of color may be as little as one-third of the lumens stated.

<pre style="margin-left: 50px">Hi Philips team,

I agree with people who said that a realistic stretch goal must not be on the critical path of the main product, that is the PicoPix Max. 
Therefore a hard case for its safety could be a very cool stretch goal : high value for backers, weak impact for Philips’ production plan. 
Hey, Backers, do you vote for that ?

But Philips, don’t miss the main point : your product’s promises are  terrific, we are looking forward to having it in hands !
Best.

<pre>Is there a repair place in Canada? Or would I have to ship to the States? Either way, shipping is expensive here. I'm excited for this projector, but not for the battery. The strict endeavours for Philips' idea for the future does not go with this short lasting battery, nor the lack of consumers ability to access and replace the battery (this is the disposable mindset).

I cannot wait wait to get it!
- Would be possible to add headset output  (if it is not possible  anymore to add optical audio output)?It would be very useful to connect it  to an amplifier in big room/many people in the room.
- would be possible to have even stronger illumination ?
Thanks a lot , and again big 5  for this amazing projector!</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">

A question regarding the battery. When I do not need the portability, I will like to use a power source instead of using battery power to preserve the battery charge cycle. Does keeping the power plugged in when the battery is full affect it negatively in anyway? In addition, is the battery removable or is it built-in?</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">

Please excuse me if this has already been answered; I couldn't find it -

I understand that the device will support casting *from* android phone etc., but will it support casting *to* devices e.g. tablet or Android TV.? It could be helpful for diagnostic purposes, but also to access all the great features of the PicoPix; if the DLP engine could be simultaneously turned off to save LED life I'd be very happy indeed.!

Keep up the good work! :)</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>hello David, the PicoPix Max is a receiver, not a client. So you cannot cast from the device to other device like TVs for eg. </pre>
 ⤷  David Johnston :  
<pre>Thanks, understood - to keep it compatible with protected content, issues would practically arise. 
For me personally, it was a hope that I could use the sound system attached to my android TV with the TV picture off, but I'm sure I'll find a solution for my needs.
Still very much looking forward to next month - it's important to know what the device won't do as much as all the great stuff it is capable of!

Thank you all for your continued efforts on this exciting new tech! This will be my first projector and I want to optimize the AV experience and setup convenience. Consider the scenario where source video comes from phone and I connect to PicoPix via USB-C. Which connection is preferable: A. phone&lt;&gt;Bluetooth Speaker or B. PicoPix&lt;&gt;Bluetooth speaker, or are they equal? If my phone is connected via USB-C (no AUX), can I still connect my Bluetooth speaker via AUX&lt;&gt;PicoPix?</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Philip, what could be the source of video on your phone?</pre>
 ⤷  Philip Howell :  
<pre>Most often the source will be VOD and/or Live streaming services like Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, UFC, Red Bull etc. I guess if the PicoPix will have native app support for all those services, then I won't need to connect my phone? Is there a way to see all the digital streaming services supported natively in PicoPix?</pre>

A lot of apps are country sensitive and we cannot load all of them. You will be able to load it from the store or direct apk. More over you cannot install android TV as it requires a special cpu and is like a new operating system. Like trying to install MacOs on a Pc. Cheers!</pre>
 ⤷  Brendon McCarthy :  
<pre>Thanks for the reply. Amazon Prime, Hulu, Disney, HBO all have current apps that could be tested before launch to confirm compatibility :) For app stores, Google Play (https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/google-play-store/) could also be tested? Or any of the more secure third-party stores like F-Droid, APKPure. RE: Android TV, the concern is if apps will be TV friendly, Android TV apps are designed for TV (e.g. https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/youtube-for-android-tv-android-tv/).</pre></div></div>

<pre style="margin-left: 50px">Hi, you said you tested the Capsule II in front of your product. You said your product is almost 4 times brighter, which is good. I'd be interested to hear the results of the speakers comparaison? Also, how the fans noise compare? Cheers</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>HB, in terms of speakers, as our engine and battery are bigger, our speakers are a little bit less powerful compared to Nebula. On there side, they almost have 70% of the unit for sound, but we decided to get a bigger battery and brighter engine and Full HD DMD. We are currently fine tuning the sound. </pre>
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>In terms of fan noise, as our engine is 4 times more bright and bigger, the fan will run a bit higher than them.</pre>
 ⤷  H B :  
<pre>Hey, thanks for these honest answers. That is what I thought and that's why I since the begining of the campaign I asked if some hardware upgrade on the speakers (to cover fan noise and deliver a proper all-in-one experience) would be possible. Any update on that part? Thanks</pre>
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Hello HB, the fan noise is totally covered by the speakers. Even if we have smaller speakers than some of our competitors, they sound great. No we have no space to implement bigger speakers. </pre>
 ⤷  H B :  
<pre>I hope it is covered haha, but I meant at lower volume because sometimes you dont want to push volume at max level. I tried the 5w speaker on the Capsule I and it was pretty much trash, that's why I'm concerned about those 2 x 4w tiny speakers (the Capsule 2 8w speaker is actually good (deep and loud)).</pre>
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>HB, it's just a question of space. Bigger speaker, bigger power, need bigger space. Adding the same speakers used on the Nebula would increase the size of our projector by at least 4cm high... </pre>
 ⤷  H B :  
<pre>Maybe something not as big, but like a middle ground, is there a big difference in terms of space for 5 or 6 watts speakers that would contribute to offer a better experience?</pre></div></div>

There has been already a lot of talk about how you can power and charge your PicoPix Max with a 45W power bank - which is a great feature!

<div id="MTU3NQ==">Mika Myllyvaara :  
<pre style="margin-left: 50px">Just what HB said. You say that ANSI Lumens and ANSI Color lumens are not same. Still you compare Nebula Capsule II 200 ANSI Lumens to Pico Pix Max 800 ANSI Color Lumens directly. How much more bright is Philips PicoPix Max really? What’s difference of ANSI Lumens and yours ANSI Color Lumens? Yes it’s fullhd but we are not talking of resolution, we are talking about brightness and using different measurements that we don’t fully understand.</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Mika, 
Even without comparing us to this competitor, we can already tell you that we are more bright because they use an old TI DMD which is only 120 ANSI, enhanced to 200 and only 720p. More Over, we just tested the Nebula Capsule 2 now in front of our PicoPix Max: 1: the throw ratio is higher on Capsule, meaning their image is far smaller than our with the same wall distance.

<pre>Is this the right calculation? Paying extra 222$ doesn't seem worth to me. As I told you earlier I already have pico projector with 510 ansi lumens. I don't think I should upgrade by paying so much of import duty. Instead I will pay extra $500 and will get LG HF65LA Ultra Short Throw LED Home Theater CineBeam Projector .Can you able to confirm if the above calculation is correct. </pre>

<pre>Hello There, if you read the entire conversation from the beginning, this topic has been approached several times. We concluded that Android OS is the best solution. It is not a question of money but a question of usability. Also, Android TV requires Netflix full integration which they are not able to support if you don't sell less the 500,000 units of 1 device (PicoPix Max). Also, it requires a special platform, meaning we would need to totally change the PCBA. Thanks and have a great day!</pre></div></div>

Or at least provide a better hard-shell shock proof case instead of a soft neoprene case that offers no protection?

Thanks for all the replies so far.
I have another query on the durability of the PicoPix Max. As this is advertised as a portable projector that we can bring anywhere we want, does this device have any shockproof rating? As we will be bringing it around in our luggage/bagpack/etc. there are bound to be some vigorous movements involved. Especially in check-in luggages where the airport staffs tend to chuck them around roughly.</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">
 ⤷  Philips Projection :

<div id="MTYxMA==">Rahul Bandekar :  
<pre style="margin-left: 50px">I agree with Jibin333. The colour lumens is very confusing. I already have one smart dlp led android pico projector with 510 Ansi lumens. And contrast ratio is 3000:1. Inbuilt battery life is 2.5 hrs. Infact has all the feature except my projector has native resolution of 1280 x 800. I backed this project looking at the lumens figure. But now I am worried with the colour lumens. If it is going below 600 ansi lumens and not colour lumens then it is not worth for me to buy.</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Unfortunately, the rule that ANSI Lumens are a universal measurement of brightness for projectors is simply not the case. ANSI Lumens refers to the measurement of determining the brightness of white pixels and was adapted for lamp based projectors. Current projector technology like LED projectors with RGB-B have better color saturation and appear brighter than lamp based projectors. </pre>
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>With the evolution of both the content that we watch and the projectors themselves, standard ANSI Lumens are now obsolete. We are using the term Color Lumens which better describes how bright the image will actually look. Essentially, Color Lumens = Lumens + Vivid Color + Fine Tuned Picture Settings.
</pre>
 ⤷  Rahul Bandekar :  
<pre>I don't understand the concept of colour lumens. I am just expecting that your projector has to be more superior than what I have right now. I am happy with your projector specification only just the confusion was of lumens. I hope this one has the best colour, bright enough and crisp image to watch live sports like football and tennis and play game on xbox one.  </pre>

Concerning the stretch goal, it's a good idea but this project is not only about money. Stretch goal has been defined to say: 50K to make 1 product with A-B specs in Z timeline. Making an extra Goal for C-D specs will increase a lot the timeline and we wouldn't be able to keep the schedule. As we say in French: " The most beautiful woman/man can only give what she/he has".

<div id="MTYzOQ==">Oliver :  
<pre style="margin-left: 50px">Please relax, people … Devices with LiIon batteries contain circuits that take care of the minimum and maximum charging level. So when you see “100 %”, then it is at the maximum that the circuit deems healthy for that particular battery, NOT the absolute physical maximum you can push into it. So charging to 100 % is fine.

Similarly, when the level is displayed as “0 %” and the device switches off automatically, then the battery is NOT really completely empty either, otherwise it would be dead.</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">

Can you explain if the number of perks is unlimited? why does the number always increase again when it is closer to 20s? I've been seeing this for few days now.

Second question: is it possible to add a battery control mode to the projector, for example a mode that will only charge the battery up to 80%, this will increase the lifetime of the battery for users who plan to keep the projector connected to a power source most of the time at their homes.

Thanks :)</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">

 ⤷  Alaa Talaat :  
<pre>Sorry but your answers are not so clear. what does it mean controlling your backend stock? how many perks are available out there? can you give this information?

Keeping the battery always charged at 100% level decreases its life, so I'm asking if it is possible to add a "battery care mode" to charge only untill 80% not 100%

<pre style="margin-left: 50px">Hey guys,

Great work on seeing the BT5 implementation and the battery bypass! Really great features! I assume you'll keep everyone updated (with example) on the BT latency? A projector without synced audio is a bad product I'm sure you'll agree! 

I do feel a slight sting reading 600 lumens on battery. Perhaps don't market it as 800 lumens portable, it gives the wrong idea.. or add the details about it in the description.

Still, great work and keep it up!</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Hello Geoffrey
Yes we will keep everyone updated about all the new features. We are still working on it.
For the 800 Lumens, we are always talking about "up to". The 800 are obtained with the power adapter plugged in! cheers!</pre>
 ⤷  Geoffrey :  
<pre>No worries, that's why I'm always skeptical of anything "up to" ;)
One more question then, just for fun. The 800 Lumens, is it also achieved when using a powerbank? I guess it'd need to supply the 45 watts perhaps?</pre>
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Yes exactly! </pre></div></div>

<pre>Here is a comparison of Bluetooth codec latencies for flagship android phones: https://www.soundguys.com/android-bluetooth-latency-22732/

The best you can get is apparently still over 200ms without aptx low latency which is simply not acceptable for video content. I can understand that it is not possible to include an aptx low latency chip at this price point but please take it into consideration.</pre>

Some vendors simply ignore fixing security vulnerabilities and leave the product insecure for a very long time or at worst, forever.</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Dear Karl, we understand your concern. However, a projector is not a mobile phone and less likely to be targeted by malware. The number of application per projector is likely to be around 10 where smartphones can count around 150. Our users won't pay with it nor check their email directly within the projector. That's said, the PicoPix Max is already very secured ad we will do some patches but not every months. Have a great day!</pre>
 ⤷  Karl :  
<pre>This projector might not be a mobile phone but a mobile device which will be exposed to many hostile environments. Just like fridges (usually you dont check mail and pay with this one either) and other IOT things that gets hacked and for instance, becoming a member of a criminal botnet due to low security standards.

This would be wirelessly connected to two sonos play 1’s for surround sound. Then I would have an Apple TV 3 either plugged into the sonos beam or the projector on the other side of the room. How would you suggest I get surround sound working without any sound lag with this Pico projector? Can you let me know what kit would help?</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">

<pre>Thanks. I’ll look into what that involves</pre>

<pre>How would I do what you said? Apple TV only has one HDMI out port. So how do I connect a sonos beam to it via optical when the Apple TV is connected to the PICOPIX already? Preferably I’d like very few or no wires across the room and the projector would be 10-12 feet back from the beam. Do I need to get some kind of splitters to get a HDMI out to turn into a HDMI and Optical out? Then wire up 10 feet across the room with the optical out to plug sound into the sonos beam from the Apple TV? </pre>

<pre>Just to be clear. There is no optical out on the back of the Apple TV. my one anyway </pre>

<pre>Hello Tony, unfortunately not, we have an NDA with Texas Instrument and cannot disclose it. Sorry about this. Is there anything I can help with? Do you have a specific question on the chipset? thanks!</pre>
 ⤷  Tony Petrilli :  
<pre>The reason for asking about the chipset is due to what has happened on another IGG campaign for the PIQO Projector where the campaigner claimed specific capabilities and specific components. 

Only for early backers to receive it, disassemble the device, and discover that  both the capabilities and components were far less than claimed.</pre>
 ⤷  Tony Petrilli :  
<pre>Getting chipset info for your projector would go a long way to ensuring that backers are getting what is claimed.

Some of your backers are likely to back out before the campaign deadline without such info in order to avod the disaster that the PIQO campaign has become.</pre>
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Hello Tony, with regards to Piqo; they are "competitors" and we will not comment.

4: The Philips PicoPix Max is made for use both indoor and outdoor. For the best results, a dimmed space is best. However, it’s bright enough that it will work well even in lit indoor spaces without direct light on the projection surface.

1: the PicoPix Max runs on Battery
2: When the battery is empty, you can plug the projector to charge the battery and also use the projector at the same time

the Samsung TV (Remote) f.e. can definitely control the FireTV using HDMI-CEC protocol :-) Using it all the time when I visit my father in law!

Another Idea: The current FireTV Remote has Volume Rockers and an Power Off/On Button to pair with other Devices via Infrared. You Just need to make sure that your Philips specific Infrared Codes are known by the FireTV Operation System (A lot Philips TVs are already supported) ;-)</pre>
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Jan, it' also a question of CEC control inside the system. For the moment we are considering it but we have already some new features we are working on. This is a lower priority for us but we keep this suggestion on our mind! Thanks again!</pre></div></div>

<pre>and concerning the battery: I've read multiple articles which state that a li-Ion-battery should be drained till max. 20 percent and should be charged till max 95 percent capacity, never 0-100 for avoiding any damage of the battery. You've been stating the complete opposite, which I honestly do not trust as much as the articles I've read concerning this topic.</pre>
 ⤷  Jens :  
<pre>Overall i found it a bit annoying that important hardfacts like the refreshrates

<pre>Hello, thanks for the values. Quite a difference, isn't it?!? 

Another question: Is there a difference in Ansi lumens when the beamer is plugged in or running on battery?</pre>
 ⤷  Jens :  
<pre>And is there no way to include a higher native contrast? Bit afraid that the picture might be looking washed out at only 600:1. Even Anker's pico-beamers got at least 1000:1. 1500:1 would of course be even better.</pre>
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Jens, Anker Capsule is 400:1 for eg. We cannot higher the native contrast because this is linked to the Texas Instrument DMD. Please keep also in mind that this is a portable device.

Still, I don't understand the decision to go with IGG, a crowdfunding site. You have the capitol to develop new products already. Also, your ads call this a "pre-order"; IGG is not meant for shopping. IGG has ZERO consumer protections, and in my mind, doesn't have the greatest reputation anymore.

<pre style="margin-left: 50px">1) How much does it weigh?
2) Is Chromecast functionality supported from apps like YouTube and Netflix? Or is Miracast/Airplay the only option? Unfortunately video doesn't tend to stream smoothly through Miracast and Airplay.</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Hello Michael!
1: 850g or 1.87pounds
2: Airplay and Miracast work very well without any problem. The PicoPix Max as also Youtube and Netflix already installed so you don't need to use Miracast or Airplay!
3: We are investigating about Google Cast but seems that the Google team in charge doesn't want to onboard new manufacturers. 
Thanks!</pre>
 ⤷  michaelketigian :  
<pre>Being able to use Google Assistant to initiate videos with voice is a MAJOR feature. I have the Nebula Capsule II, and this can be achieved through the Assistant-enabled remote, or through a phone, since it has Google Cast. 

Considering Philips has been around much longer and probably has deeper resources, I'd be very surprised to hear that Google wouldn't support this device, especially given that Anker was able to get certification.</pre>
 ⤷  michaelketigian :  
<pre>Also —&nbsp; I've had very poor results with streaming video over Airplay and Miracast. It requires quite a snappy WiFi network, and given the portable element here, it's very hard to have that guaranteed. Google Cast would make this a go for me — the rest of the features are excellent, very much including horizontal keystone.

Thanks for sharing the weight. I had searched with cmd+f, but it's listed within an image.</pre>
 ⤷  michaelketigian :  
<pre>Last question, regarding Lumen count —&nbsp;Nebula Capsule lists 200 ANSI lumens. I saw a prior response that didn't really address the commenter's question about brightness. Can you provide a comparison of the brightness of this device against other products on the market? Capsule 2 would be great, since it feels like a direct competitor.</pre>
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Hello Michael, yes we have the Capsule 2 here and we will compare is soon. our PicoPix Max cannot directly compete because its resolution is Full HD but the Capsule 2 is only HD. More Over, their Netflix version only project in 480p. Have a great day!</pre>
 ⤷  michaelketigian :  
<pre>Yes I know it's 720 vs 1080, but that shouldn't affect brightness... they claim 200 ANSI. I'd be surprised if this is 4x brighter, but would love to see a photo comparison. 

Also, can't overstate the importance of Google Cast support, or a similar kind of Assistant integration. It makes the UX soooo much better than dealing with directional pad text input ?‍♂️

Yeah 480p Netflix is lame. I'm open to an improved setup, and have voiced my requirements to upgrade! ?</pre>
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Hello Michael, thanks for your input, the DMD and Light engine as nothing to do with them so we cannot really compare. For the assistant, you need to have Android TV to get the Google assistant and we didn't decided to go that way because the PicoPix Max is a portable device. We are discussing with another brand doing those kind of assistant but it's too early to talk about it :-) Hope you gonna like our Max!</pre></div></div>

<div id="MTc3Mw==">Lorenzo Monachini :  
<pre style="margin-left: 50px">Can you please clarify the Lumens?
ANSI Color Lumens doesn't exist. It exist ANSI lumens and Color Light Output. The CLO method is similar to ANSI, but instead of using a 100% white test pattern, one uses red, green and blue test patterns instead. Separate meter readings are taken for red, green, and blue, then added together. It means that if 800 is the sum it's something between 250 to 300 ANSI Lumens. I thought Philips was an honest company.</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Dear Lorenzo, thanks for your question. We understand your concern. Unfortunately, the rule that ANSI Lumens are a universal measurement of brightness for projectors is simply not the case. ANSI Lumens refers to the measurement of determining the brightness of white pixels and was adapted for lamp based projectors. Current projector technology like LED projectors with RGB-B have better color saturation and appear brighter than lamp based projectors. </pre>
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>With the evolution of both the content that we watch and the projectors themselves, standard ANSI Lumens are now obsolete. The reality is that is you take 2 projectors from 2 different brands with the same advertised ANSI lumens, you will see a very big difference. We are using the term Color Lumens which better describes how bright the image will actually look. Essentially, Color Lumens = Lumens + Vivid Color + Fine Tuned Picture Settings.
</pre>
 ⤷  Lorenzo Monachini :  
<pre>You explained what is Color Lumens, but I can't understand what is ANSI Color Lumens. ANSI is a thing and Color Lumens seems to be very different. I'm agree that nowaday with Led projector ANSI is not accurate, but it is a standard measurement, here you're inventing something else so you can't write ANSI if it doesn't respect the ANSI measurement. </pre></div></div>

1. Regarding VAT, I assume you are gonna declare the price of product as the full price (899 EUR excludes VAT) instead of the discount price to the customs, right? This matters because how much VAT I need to pay depends on how much you declare.
2. Nena's question (2 levels below me) is also my doubt. Please answer it.</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">

<pre style="margin-left: 50px">Hi team, since many answers are avoided, let me ask again :
1- do you agree to refund if your forwarder wants to charge more than VAT, as it happens when they need to handle taxes ?
2- Which refresh rates are being natively displayed (50Hz, 60Hz, 23.976Hz, 24Hz, 25Hz)?
3- VAT only applies to purchased items. We are contributing money towards the completion of your project and you provide us samples in return.
Why should we pay VAT ?
Please answer questions, stop turning them around..</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Bonjour Nicolas!
As a backer, you are contributing towards a project. This project is to be the very first to buy a product at very aggressive conditions. We asked several time our legal team and their answer is quite clear: each backer will receive a product against his contribution to the project. So in fact, according to local laws in US and Europe, you are indirectly buying a product, and therefore, you have to pay the VAT. </pre>
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Sorry, we are not making Laws, and we pay a lot of attention to respect them. And we hope you share the same point of view.</pre>
 ⤷  LEGRET Nicolas :  
<pre>I do. I don't make laws either, but I know how to read and understand them.
Perks offered (=gifts) are NOT subjected to VAT in my country !

Also, in my country, when we buy something online, we are eligible BY LAW to consumer warranties, which do not exist when contributing to indiegogo's projects.</pre>

<pre>Hello, the PicoPix Max has 24 months warranty. Wish you a sunny day in South of France!</pre>
 ⤷  LEGRET Nicolas :  
<pre>Yes, that's what you say, as others do on this site.
But reality is, nothing can enforce you to act once the "sale" is made, thus you don't respect the law, with the help of your "partner" indiegogo.</pre></div></div>

Another shipping question for you. I am in Canada, so I am assuming that you will be shipping to Canada from the United States. If this is the case, then Duty may be involved along with any potential taxes.

1: yes you will be able to get the image on our projector and the sound on your AV receiver, but only if you have optical out on your PS4 or BR player
2: No you cannot push the content from Netflix on your phone to the projector because they blocked this feature some months ago. Youtube is working for sure. In any case, Netflix is already installed in our device and you can simply add you account there!. Easy right?</pre>
 ⤷  Jens :  
<pre>mmmhm ok. Its a bit a pity ,cos there's no wifi in our garden. So that would have been very conveniant if I could have used simply my mobile plan where video's included ^^ but well. Not your fault :)</pre>
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Hello Jens, yes you are right, it's a question of security in the stream. My 2 cents: just a 69 USD Wi-Fi extender in your garden and you will be able to watch movies without draining your plan!</pre>
 ⤷  Jens :  
<pre>Theoretically yes, practically no, the garden's not close to our house :) </pre>
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Other solution for you: activate the hotspot mode on your phone so you the PicoPix Max can connect directly to it!</pre>
 ⤷  Jens :  
<pre>@Tony Petrilli , Philips: Im not quite sure if the hotspot-solution is sufficient. Will see. Next year, except there's a warm Indian summer incoming this year. Thanks for your thoughts.

I just wondered, how much distance is needed for getting the full 120" sharp and crystal clear?</pre>
 ⤷  Jens :  
<pre>Another question: is there a 120" projection screen you can recommend?</pre>
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Hello Jens, unfortunately no, there are thousand or product out there. It also depends on your wall. You can purchase a model with a frame (non removable) or an electric one. Also, there are many models with different ratio of reflexion. 150euros should be ok</pre></div></div>


<div id="MTgyOA==">Will Plaister :  
<pre style="margin-left: 50px">I bit the bullet and backed it! Pretty darn excited about this product to be honest :D 
I just had one last question: Any idea how much the "premium digital zoom" can shrink the image size by? For example, if it was a 120" image could it be shrunk down to a 60" image?
Ps I think mini toslink/3.5mm is clever idea (like airport express/macbook) and another 'backer' mentioned HDMI ARC. One of these would be handy for future-proofing or dealing with potential sync/audio latency issues.
Regards,
Will</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">

<pre>hello Andres, 
Our PicoPix Max is considered as a portable device and can be also connected to an extra speaker via Bluetooth. For the moment, our PicoPix Max is not able to connect to 5.1 or 7.1 surround system. The other solution is to plug an external smart box like an Apple TV for eg, forward the image to the projector, and the audio to your surround system. Wish you a great day!</pre></div></div>

Yes, you can connect the Apple TV via HDMI to our PicoPix Max. You speakers must be connected to you Apple TV as well. Then you can forward the sound to optical directly in you Apple TV (OPTICAL OUT menu). Have a great day!</pre>
 ⤷  Theo Naidoo :

 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Hello Theo! You are welcome.
Your iOS devices, MacOS devices can simply use the Airplay system to throw image and videos directly to our projector (Screen Mirroring).

After all, this is supposed to be a portable unit, and I plan to connect it to a portable BlueTooth speaker anyway (JBL Charge 3), so I don't need the built-in speakers at all. And I don't think you'll be able to compete with the sound quality of an external speaker anyway.</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">
 ⤷  Oliver :  
<pre>Also, if supporting BlueTooth 5 means incorporating a separate chip (separate from the WLAN chip, I mean), thus taking more power, thus reducing battery life – then please refrain from doing that. This is a portable device, so you have to try to find some middle-ground. You can't make a do-everything gadget. Size and battery life are KEY factors for a portable device.

<pre style="margin-left: 50px">I am sure you'll make a great software and sell 500K/year with good speakers ;)
"Concerning the sound, we are working on it" meaning you might consider an upgrade on the speakers?

Speakers are important, as I said an all in one solution require good speakers. Also, will you be able to use it only as an external bluetooth speaker without projection? The Capsule II can do that too and it is quite usefull.</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Hello HB, Very good sound means space. The speaker room (the box where is the speaker) is as much important as the speaker used, as well as the tuning made for them. in the case of the Capsule, they used a very big space for the speakers, but they sacrifice the brightness, battery and resolution. For sure we need to get the best sound as possible, but we cannot increase the size of our product, nor decrease other specifications. We are looking at a solutions for speakers and BT5.</pre>
 ⤷  H B :  
<pre>Great news! As I asked before, will I be able to use the PP Max as a bluetooth speaker to stream music from an external device? Again, what people also like with the Capsule is that they dont need to buy/bring an external bluetooth speaker. It is a portable/travel projector so it has to be versatile.

Plenty of more powerfull, cheaper (and little bigger) projectors are already on the market if you mostly want to leave it at home and pair it with speakers.</pre>

<div id="MTg2NQ==">H B :  
<pre style="margin-left: 50px">Hi, just wondering if 2x 4w speakers would not be too weak for a travel projector. I mean a great quality picture with tiny sound would make an external bluetooth speaker essential and kill the whole purpose of an all-in-one travel projector solution. Just some thoughts.</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Hello HB.
IN order to maximise the size of the product, we need to keep the speakers as small as possible but the power delivered is enough. For example the bluetooth speaker JBL Clip 3 is only 1x3watts and made for outdoor!</pre>
 ⤷  H B :  
<pre>Yes but the capsule I has a 5w speaker and it is actually really weak. The Capsule II I own has 8w and it's much better (deep and loud). I don't want to feel a sound downgrade switching to the PP Max and that is probably the only thing Capsule II has over the PP Max (and Android TV OS maybe).</pre>
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Hi HB, the Capsule 2 is only HD 720P, our PicoPix Max is Full HD 1080p, this is one of the biggest difference on the capsule, there are many other features that are no in the Capsule and I can detail them if you want to. You wont regret moving to the PicoPix Max!</pre>
 ⤷  H B :  
<pre>Yes thats why i said your speakers and maybe the OS are the only downsides in comparaison with the Capsule 2. The Capsule 2 has an 8w speaker with a very good sound and Im not sure 2x 4w can match that. It would be too bad to have a better picture but a worst sound than your only direct competitor. 

Android TV OS is very good too. </pre>
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>hello HB, it really depends on the consumer target, a lot of our consumers prefer to get Android OS rather than Android TV. You can get Android TV quiet easily but you wont be able to get Neftlix on Android TV because they require very big volume on the same device (around 500K unit per year). That's why we chose Android OS for the moment. Concerning the sound, we are working on it :-)</pre>
 ⤷  H B :  
<pre>I am sure you’ll make a great software and sell 500K/year with good speakers ;)
“Concerning the sound, we are working on it” meaning you might consider an upgrade on the speakers?

Speakers are important, as I said an all in one solution require good speakers. Also, will you be able to use it only as an external bluetooth speaker without projection? The Capsule II can do that too and it is quite usefull.

(sorry for double post)</pre></div></div>

 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Hello Ticanaus.
Our engineers have found that the term ANSI Lumens can vary from manufacturer to manufacturer, as the term generally refers to outdated technology and has yet to be updated to describe the performance of a projector when rendering full color imagery. We are using the term Color Lumens as defined by our engineers to measure the real number of lumens based on the color/brightness/gamma adjustment settings we have defined in our lab. Essentially, Color Lumens = Lumens + Vivid Color </pre>

<pre>Dear Fabien, the source (your BD Player or gaming console) will do the decoding and if you want to play the image over the PicoPix Max and forward the 5.1 sound to your AV receiver, it will be possible to do it via optical out for eg. If your movie is played from the internet or your USB stick/MicroSD, VLC or Kodi will do the decoding.

Our engineers have found that the term ANSI Lumens can vary from manufacturer to manufacturer.

Essentially, Color Lumens = Lumens + More Vivid Color + Fine Tuned Picture Settings.

<pre style="margin-left: 50px">I am excited to see in person how this performs. I have also contributed to another Pico projector on Indiegogo and plan a head-to-head competition.

The #1 weakness that jumped out at me was the internal storage. With the prices of various storage options on the market at cheap prices, 128GB should be the BARE minimum, but since this is video 256GB minimum with a 512GB option would make much more sense. I mean I have a S10+ phone with 1TB internal storage (yes retail $ is high).</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>When we made the market's survey, we found out that more than 90% of Consumers only need 16GB memory or less.

But we did wanted to address the 10% left, this is why we added a MicroSD solution (and of course USB). 

Finally, we added all streaming features that will allow you to use your smartphone.</pre>
 ⤷  mmancpa :  
<pre>I believe that in the 90% that responded to lead you to a 16GB solution, probably 75% of those respondents don't understand storage needs for video, prices, etc. What is the max capacity of the SD Card slot, for if it's 512Gb or higher than that would alleviate most storage issues. But honestly in this day and age I feel that a 16GB internal memory solution is a cost cutting measure that can be measured probably in a few dollars. I personally like ability for high end internal storage.</pre></div></div>

The unique feature is the lamp power of 800 lumens. For a screen size of 120 inches I would expect a higher output resolution. Could you explain 4k compatible? Does that mean it just scales it down to 1080p or can the projector technically produce a higher image quality?

 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Hello, 

Yes you can use your iOS, MacOS or Android device to wirelessly mirror screen your devices!
Around 40ms for the lag time on HDMI. Our team of engineers are currently working to decrease it.</pre>
 ⤷  H B :  
<pre>Great, can you use the cast feature in apps like YouTube/Netflix to cast app specific content or you have to cast the whole device by mirror screening?</pre>

<pre style="margin-left: 50px">Hi, 

Everybody has a question that if this is legitimate Philips product or a Scam. The Philips customer care team don't know anything about this sale or product. Neither the picopix.com website mention has any relations with Philips official site. 

Can you let everybody know about the authenticity of this sale and relation with Philips. 

Thanks</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Hello Bhadresh, 

We will ask our Philips Team to do so.
The is a genuine product and we decided not to have it on the Philips website for the moment because it's only focusing on Indiegogo.

<div id="MjA0Ng==">Christer Hansen Eriksen :  
<pre style="margin-left: 50px">Can you please explain Native Resolution 1080p vs 4K support? What does that actually mean? And your marketing material mentions 4KHDR10, but nowhere else is HDR specified. Can you please tell us more about it's HDR capabilities?</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Hello Christer, 

The Philips PicoPix Max will project an image in Full HD. If you plug an external BLuray player or Apple TV 4K, the signal will be 4K and the projector will project Full HD. 
Concerning HDR, the projector will decode HDR signal and adjust all colors like a TV</pre>
 ⤷  Christer Hansen Eriksen :  
<pre>Okay, I got the 4K part. No 4K support, you downscale it. Sneaky marketing.

Will the projector display an HDR image, or "convert" HDR to SDR? Your answer was not clear to me and I don't know what you mean by "adjust all colors like a TV". Please explain wether it has HDR capabilities or not. Your marketing material clearly is making that statement, but you're not backing that up anywhere else.</pre></div></div>

yes! It need to be powerful enough</pre></div></div>


<div id="MjA0OA==">Mathieu jobic :  
<pre style="margin-left: 50px">One of the image you use on the page of the website is something like "long live grafity" so i assume the projector can do the same and only show some words and not a full empty screen ?</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px">
 ⤷  Philips Projection :  
<pre>Hi Mathieu, 

Yes indeed, in fact you just need to create a movie without background or black background, same for images.</pre>
 ⤷  Mathieu jobic :  
<pre>Cool, thnk, so .npg for image and for movie something with alpha enable so it doesn't show anything else that the image ? Or when you say with black background the projector can be set not to show black ?</pre></div></div>

The projector doesn't support 3D. We made survey on 1,000 users and 87% of them are not using 3D anymore.

- it depends on your charger, it needs to supply enough power. The MacBook Pro 13 and 15" can charge it for eg

- We are currently working with those services to include them</pre><div style="margin-left: 100px"></div></div>
