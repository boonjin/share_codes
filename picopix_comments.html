Please explain this, because it should be impossible without a loss in resolution (not definition).

Also, why would we need to free up RAM ?I thought this was handled very well by android 9 already... isn't it ?</pre>

Is 31 inch the closest you can project so the text can still be readable?
What about the smallest screen size for the same purpose? I'm thinking about 24''.

there is a slight chance it might work

Try looking for this in google "external dvd player on android" there seem to be some people able to make them run on an android box for tv, but they say you need a compatible dvd player for it to work, it seem kinda flimsy, wouldn't be better to copy an iso of your dvd on an hard drive and then trying to read it ? Also you need a usb charger to run the dvd player it seem, so that not very transportable in the middle of nowhere</pre>

Also, I paid for the product in the US, but I will be travelling to visit family and friends in Hong Kong. If I change the delivery address to Hong Kong, do I still need to pay for VAT or duties? (HK doesn't have VAT as far as I know).

I think vlc can read it but its been a while since i play a dvd on a pc, i don't even have a dvd/cd player on my pc anymore. Check it if you already have a external dvd player, try to play it with vlc and you will have your answer (also share it here) but my money is on vlc, it can read everything, the only issue i found with it is hdr .m2ts file with a bit of lag, but they are getting there with every update</pre>

            <pre>Tom, we explained many times how we measure it and other competitors may say they use ANSI but how come 1000 ansi is jot the same on 2 different competitors?

            <pre>Oh absolutely, perhaps I didn't articulate what I was saying properly. Since competitors see differences in real world brightness even though they use the same test, I'm interested to see if the Picopix's more rigorous method will mean that real world brightness is competitive with other, supposedly brighter, models.

Does that make more sense?</pre>

They are using a dpl of texas intrument, same as the picomax, but i don't get your comment or argument if it is one, i went and check, like most company that sell 2 version, they brag on the most powerfull one, kinda normal to have 4k for a 1600 dollars price don't you think ?

as for the 1080p version, it might be a bit better with 900 lumen, but its fat compare to the pico max, 3.3lb (1497g) vs 1.87 lb (850g) for the pico max, so almost x2, and its also bigger</pre>

Btw this "lumens hunt" is a bit ridiculous considering most ppl watch movies in the evening, lights down (if you watch movies in the daytime, get a life). Also this is a PORTABLE projector, made for TRAVEL. If not, buy a bigger/brighter unit you r****ds.</pre>

            <pre>Again, the focus should be on VERSATILITY for a nomadic use (better SOUND, Bluetooth speaker only mode, low noise, etc.). I bought this to replace my Capsule II but I realize your speakers won't even compete with the 8w speaker of the Capsule II, while having a way more noisy fan to cool down those extra lumens I won't need. Because, you know, I watch movies at night (crazy uh?).</pre>

            <pre>Having 1080p and other software perks (Netflix, GMS (??), etc), is nice, but honestly you had the possibility to kill the game once for all and you just didn't because you focused too much on lumens which increased fan noise and took space you could have used for a better sound system. Reminds me how camera manufacturers focused only on pixels at some point. I hope I'll be wrong though.</pre>

I see your honest effort to support the team and their efforts. No doubt that they're doing a great job! But I don't need someone to tell me 40dB is the noise of a fridge etc. What I need to know is how come, out of a sudden, the engine changed with a bit more brightness (6%) and much higher noise level (51% in comparison to 28.5 and 36% in comparison to 30dB, see I know some science too!). And LEGRET Nicolas is right, we don't watch Hollywood action movies all the time.</pre>

            <pre>At last, a 34dB sound if the projector is near your ear is really uncomfortable, and everyone won't have the privilege to place it far enough (4-corner correction also degrades quality a little bit, which some might want to avoid)</pre>

They say they would try to get close to it, be reasonable, a refregirator is at 40db, also 30 db is a Quiet rural area, Very Quiet.
That the data i got from https://www.industrialnoisecontrol.com/comparative-noise-examples.htm

Any movie that you watch will cover that noise, conversation level are at 60db, the only issue you might have is if you are watching silent movie.

850 lumen is really hot, i for one don't want the thing to melt or need to stop to cool down every 40 minutes</pre>

You really want to spend 50 euros or more on a stand that is not usefull at all ? The pico can correct the ratio so you don't have to put the projector at the center of the room, you can actually put it on a shelve next to a wall on the right or left of the room and its fine, it also resolve the issue of cable management you were talking about because even if the stand has that you still have to hide the cable that plug in an outlet so you will have a cable on the floor.</pre>

            <pre>I get the hard case accessory because i want that too, same with the external powerfull batterie because you need a high output to charge the device on the go, but i feel the stand you ask for would take on dust after a while.
Thats why the original stand is more than enought because its low to the ground.
Also a stand like that have a higher chance to be knock over, i don't know about you but i don't want to take that chance on a 900 euro+ projector.</pre>

        <pre class="comment">Hi Philips,

Happy to be a backer of this great project :)

I know it's probably too late, but for your next projector : add an HDMI output :)
It first sound silly for a projector, but it isn't ;)

1) It's a portable smart projector, on which we can install our app and store our films. 
So it would be nice be able to connect to a TV, bigger projector, home cinema... 

2) you could send audio output to hdmi. 
Many home cinema ampli use HDMI for audio input :)
So it supports 5.1, 7.1 etc...</pre>

            <pre>Many of my friend don't have good white wall to project something and have old TV not supporting HECV, and some of them are not able to connect USB key... so it would be very cool to use the pico on their old TV with HDMI :)
A micro-HDMI for the HDMI output should be also ok.</pre>

            <pre>Hello 
1: This is not the use of this projector, unfortunately we cannot support this
2: We are testing ARC for the HDMI but not stable for the moment
3: This is not supposed to replace an Apple TV or Android TV box :-)

Plug stuff in via HDMI, they wont post a video of bluetooth because there may be a perception of lag from the video but they assure there is no lag on all the bluetooth devices they've tested. It will down scale 4K to 1080p, 1080 will always be the max it can output. Just imagine its a 1080P TV and use it how you would use that, except it's a projector.</pre>

I see where you're coming from, it makes sense from the perspective of someone who knows the limitation and can work around it. I'm the same way, someone who can work around it, or someone who doesn't HAVE to use it that way.

Still I was in here insisting on an answer. Not because I thought an affordable, portable design had to have it all. But for clarity. To know. It's not about blaming or feeling entitled to something. Hope this makes sense. Peace!</pre>

            class="comment">@Dipankar Saha, you can only receive genuine gifts upto the value of ₹5000 in India. If you have a IEC code, only then you can receive samples upto ₹1,00,000 in one financial year. There is no escaping GST. Sorry, you have your facts wrong. If they send via India post, there is a high chance of it getting stuck in customs with no explanation. I regularly order a lot of high value items and am facing this issue. The tax is on the invoice value if you are importing on personal KYC forms</pre>

 If you send the product through India Post (via NL Post) for Indian customers there should not be any VAT/GST/Import tax. I have received several electronics products through this and especially for IGG campaigns. This being a backer gift and not actual commercial product through std ecom platforms, there should not be any additional taxes. So please send it through India Post/NL Post for Indian customers to save unnecessary taxes.
Thanks,

            class="comment">The latest update mentions that you have "zero lag" over Bluetooth. Does that mean you support one of the low-latency codecs? Even latency-targeted codecs like aptX-LL have around 37-40ms of latency, but standard BT codecs (SBC, other aptX flavours) have around 200-300ms latency, which is quite noticeable.

Alternatively, will plugging in an external USB audio adaptor work? I have a Genki Audio adaptor for Nintendo Switch, and I hope I'll be able to use that with this projector if necessary.</pre>

Thanks for the update but feels like the product is still being heavily worked on, from both a hardware and software point of view, with components changing, and a “long” Google cert process going on, when we would be by now about a month or less from shipping, in which time there will also be a need to prepare mass production and, hopefully, proper QA/testing.

  an amazing option to have and making it projector ready for 2020' Is to have Option to Projection in  aspect ratio 2.35:1 .90% of new films out on Blu-ray /  streaming are in this ratio. Currently all old projectors limit aspect ratio to 16:9 so give you ugly faded black bars on top and bottom. This would think this probably be just require a software  change. I hope this is possible. It would blow away the competition.</pre>

You said «&nbsp;You’ll also be able to handle VAT costs in your BackerKit survey&nbsp;».

        <pre class="comment">@Alistair, unbelievable to read comments like this. Have backed 30+ projects in the past 5 years and so far this campaign is one of the most legitimate ones have seen. 

What disturbs me the most are comments like yours and the ones questioning whether the device can play 1080p content (the hardware supports, and the widewine L1 can be enabled with a software OTA update once the license organisation gets their paperwork through the process)

So think twice before posting irrelevant comments</pre>

You mentioned that Widevine L1 is first priority and then GMS certification. Is this an ongoing effort. Lets say by ship date if this is not implemented, can both of these be implemented over FOTA?

We're not paying more. We're paying exactly what we've been expecting to pay. 
Some lucky late-adopters have been paying slightly less. 
Is that unfortunate in terms of communication : perhaps. 
But I don't see how what I feel about a deal I signed up for should depend on whether some other guys happened to pay a little more or a little less? 
If anything the extra budget might allow to make the product I'll receive a tiny bit better. Isn't that the spirit of crowdfunding?</pre>

            class="comment">@Marco Lammers. Quite selfish comment of you because you dont care about paying more doesnt mean others have to beside that its about their way of communicating. It has been told in the beginning that how earlier you back how lower the price is and that how later to the end date the prices will raise. Thats how they attract early backers aswell and that makes it unfair in my opinion and then you are more playing on the field of pure commerce and thats what its not about in crowdfunding...</pre>

Petite question, je viens de voir ce commentaire :
"Bonjour Philips, si le videoprojecteur est dans un angle, donc pas face a l’écran est-ce la correction de l’image ce fait automatiquement ?
Cordialement."

Ainsi que la réponse : 
"Philips Projection 4 hours ago

Early adopters have had a better deal, but that deal ended 26 days ago.
Most of us have been late-adopters, just enjoying a deal we apparently liked.
Some late-adopters got lucky and have had a slightly better deal, good for them.
Now stop nagging like a spoiled kid who got a slightly smaller piece of pie. Stop crow-barring for a couple of euros of discount. You're not entitled to anything; enjoy the deal or ask for a refund.</pre>

 not fair towards the first to have backed you, not fair towards everyone after. And since your link wasn't even working, not fair for the very few lasts.

If you ask the users of your smart projector and the backers of your project, the answer is most likely that both are of high priority. That's how we want to take advantage of our Youtube Premium subscriptions.

1) What would the VAT/customs costs be if shipped to France (EU) versus if shipped to Switzerland?

2) Has it been tested okay to project onto a (white) ceiling? Will the internal components, heat distribution, and any externally connected cables still be okay when the projector is vertical? Does the tripod support this vertical orientation?

        <pre class="comment">Wow, I joined late and unfortunately I missed the free shipping. Still, I am very happy to be able to purchase such a wonderful projector at reduced price point and receive it ahead of standard release. I see a some complaints here but I must say that I am SO happy that Philips is using this platform with a really innovative product - I wished other major brands would do this once in a while. 
This is my 20th Indiegogo campaign and Philips is running this better than anyone else. Thanks!!!</pre>

Get one Philips PicoPix Max projector and its accessories at 53% off MSRP." -People now talking about that only very early backers get free shipping. Do i get free shipping, or do i have to pay for shipping?</pre>

It's completely the norm that early backers and late backers have same terms or better. It rewards early backers for getting a campaign going. Your free shipping seems scammy,really scammy.
Hi Indiegogo Team,
Is this campaign really being run by the corporate team from Philips? Please check not a scam?

This is my first time commenting as up until now I have been fine with the delay BUT I am beyond disappointed that over the weekend you included free shipping for new backers. 29 euros is a lot of money for shipping from Hong Kong to Australia but I happily paid it assuming I was getting in before the perk ran out. I honestly want my shipping refunded. 
Not letting earlier backers know of the secret perk so we could get a refund &amp; re order is completely dishonest &amp; scammy</pre>

Je viens de commander un perk de ce projecteur qui a l'air vraiment super! 
J'ai juste quelques questions:
1) Il y a 6 mois j'ai commandé un projecteur sur internet mais le colis est arrivé ouvert et vide dans ma boite au lettre. Depuis j'ai peur que ca se reproduise.
Le transporteur sera il de confiance ? Serais-je prévenu de l'arrivé du livreur pour pouvoir être présent?
2) Si le produit est défectueux et que je dois vous le renvoyez devrais-je repayer des taxes ?
Cdt,</pre>

Correct, the zoom is not optical it is only digital. Digital zoom out effectively removes pixels all the way around the image to make it smaller which technically reduces it from 1080p (total number of pixels on screen) to lower than that, but considering it is 1080p, i.e. there are a lot of pixels, you won't notice too much loss in quality. The ideal scenario is to set the zoom to maximum screen size so that it uses every pixel.</pre>

            ⤷ Philips Projection : <span class="time">11 days ago</span>
            <pre>The BT audio and video will be in sync when playing supported codecs using system APIs, by following standard latency compensation algorithm. But real-time media like games or the whole system cannot be synchronized as doing so will add latency to the whole projector’s display. For users who require low latency audio for real-time applications, Bluetooth is not suitable regardless of the codec used (like aptX). aptX for example only goes as low as 32ms. This is not enough for most music programs</pre>
            ⤷ lukesavvides : <span class="time">11 days ago</span>
            <pre>Hi, Yes this is why there should be the option for the user to add video latency if they want to. So if you are playing games then you would not use it. But if you watch movies and videos (which will be the most use case for this product) there should be an option to adjust latency in the video. Some bluetooth speakers have internal processing which can increase latency so you would adjust the video latency to ensure the video is in sync with the audio. This is the only way to guarantee sync</pre>
            ⤷ lukesavvides : <span class="time">11 days ago</span>
            <pre>Otherwise i guarantee there will be people who have sync issues because of the speaker they use when watching videos and it will cause issues. Having the user adjustment (like 5 simple levels of delay in video) is a way to guarantee you can put the video in sync with every bluetooth speaker on the market</pre>
            ⤷ Philips Projection : <span class="time">11 days ago</span>
            <pre>Luke: how do you do it on your laptop for eg?</pre>
            ⤷ lukesavvides : <span class="time">11 days ago</span>
            <pre>Well a laptop no one would typically watch a movie with Bluetooth speakers. However on VLC player you can adjust the video delay to sync with your Bluetooth speaker audio. In the instance of this projector the delay should be applied at the display level so that everything can be in sync with the audio. This would mean creating I small delay in what is being shown on screen so it is in sync. A simple 1-5 levels of adjustment would mean all Bluetooth speakers and headphones would be in sync</pre>
            ⤷ Philips Projection : <span class="time">11 days ago</span>
            <pre>VLC is installed in our projector. In any case, the video sync is too complicated to implement. Just for your reference if you want to delay system wide display by 1 second. 1920x1080 pixels times 3 bytes per pixel (24bit color) times 60 pictures per second (60 FPS refresh). That’s 356 MB of memory required + a nice CPU to process all this. Also the graphic card can’t transcode 1080p 60hz video in real-time. It can decode sure but not encode.</pre>
            ⤷ lukesavvides : <span class="time">11 days ago</span>
            <pre>Yes I understand VLC is on the system but people will of course use Netflix, amazon, youtube etc. The system wide delay only needs to be maximum 250ms, not 1 second. So 5 levels a user can select, 50, 100, 150 etc. And the delay does not need to be transcoded. Its simply delaying between the process of sending the video from the CPU to the DLP chip. So if you activate a delay it just delays sending the process to the DLP chip by that time.</pre>
            ⤷ lukesavvides : <span class="time">11 days ago</span>
            <pre>This is also something that Texas Instruments can assist with as they could help with the link between the CPU and the DLP chip in adding a delay. I think this feature would make this projector so much better than all others. If you google bluetooth delay you can see its a wide issue so having it as a selling point on your projector would be huge</pre>
            ⤷ Philips Projection : <span class="time">11 days ago</span>
            <pre>And where will this video be stored till it’s ready to be sent?</pre>
            ⤷ Philips Projection : <span class="time">11 days ago</span>
            <pre>Again, Netflix or others are auto compensating it. </pre>
            ⤷ lukesavvides : <span class="time">11 days ago</span>
            <pre>If it needs memory, at the max 250ms latency, only 89MB or RAM would be needed which is a small amount given it has 2GB. But the system should not need to transcode. It is not the video file you ware watching that is transcoded, it is the delay is between the CPU and the DLP chip. </pre>
            ⤷ lukesavvides : <span class="time">11 days ago</span>
            <pre>So all the processing the CPU does, before it sends it to the DLP chip, it can send to RAM first with the delay then to the DLP chip. This should not need transcoding as it is a simple delay function in the coding and the memory requirement is very small, only max 15 frame delay</pre>
            ⤷ lukesavvides : <span class="time">11 days ago</span>
            <pre>Netflix may also auto compensate, but there are many videos we would watch such as from video files on a USB stick, other video apps like plex, youtube etc.  This I think it why you have not seen a sync issue yet because you are using an app that has auto delay. </pre>

        <pre class="comment">oh wow that secret perk on free shipping. I know you had no experience in crowdfunding and this is more like an experiment, but It seems you are treating this like normal online retailing. The development and feedback handling are honestly great but the whole thing about pricing and free shipping and perks and all the crowdfunding aspects are really badly handled. 

Just a piece of feedback to your whole campaign.</pre>

        <pre class="comment">Hello. I joined the campaign today so I have some questions that I will ask you. But my main concern is as follows:
Although I know the quality of philips products I am afraid that new projects may have some flaws. If this happens I will have assistance here in Brazil?
The price of the projector is attractive but I will probably pay almost the same amount in import duties so it is important to know if I will be supported if I have any problems.
Thanks!</pre>

What would happen if we wanted to project a larger than 120 inch image - Would the 20% increased brightness translate also in a larger than 120 inch maximum image size? Could this be seen in the next video? (Looking at the competion I notice that significantly only in the image size you are averaging). Thanks.</pre>

According to Philips Projector there will be an YouTube App preloaded, but without possibility to login with an YouTube Account. So no YouTube Premium, No Playlists etc.

In addition to that there will also be no YouTube Music, Play Movies, Gmail and probably no Nest App!

@Google: The product is not yet released but it will be a smash Hit - See the YouTube product trailer view count of more than 3 Million Views!</pre>

We have no issues paying whatever is due. Just need to know what we are in for, upfront.

This is a very valid and fair request. It does not make sense in our "early backing" and paying a much higher end cost.

            class="comment">@Augusto Echecopar @Martin Meidl  @A Y  People, unlike your countries, the tax structure in India is excruciating.. It might even border the actual cost of the device. So unlike you with fat pockets have to be prepared. I understand you wouldn't really  care to understand, but please do try, We're not hogging down on the campaign owner to include industrial grade tech into a portable projector like a few of you, We're merely asking a little clarity on the tax stuff,</pre>

            <pre>Please also consider that we as end users are oblivious to the multiple level tax structure and import duties, BUT the shipping partner might be well informed. An email perhaps might clear the confusion. So all we ask Philips is to give us an estimate or let us know who's handling the shipping and provide a contact so we may ask enquire directly.

We are not responsible by any way of the extra cost your should or shouldn't pay in your country. the law are different are applied differently by the people handling products. </pre>

You've posted a sample video with the image in a room with low ambient light and with no light, but the video you've projected is a very simply animation. Can you show a demo of how it looks like in a low lit/dark room with some scenes where you have better distinguish between whites and darks. For example, how will a dark scene look like in a dark room and in under low ambient lights?</pre>

            class="comment">@Shantanu Tomar, you are just buying a mini projector and not a Car! Relax your ways, you are already borderline with being inappropriate.  Whatever the VAT that corresponds you to pay, you will be paying it, it is the law, not Philips charging for it. And regarding any extra fees, well, that is the risk you assume when buying something from another country, next time I suggest you to source your tech from India to avoid this kind of issues. Obviously your first crowdfunding project. Best luck.</pre>

This is outdated info. This web page talks about “GST to be introduced”. GST has been there in India for the last 3 years! Wouldn’t it be easier to ask your shipper. Quite a few of us from India here and it is definitely useful to know beforehand what we are in for and no unpleasant surprises.

 I have the ppx4935 and i use it about everyday, sometimes with friends in the woods at night, i have even made it possible to sit out and watch movies for about 12+ hours.

My point was both of the 2 picopix i have and owned have been great, but i always have 2 buy them second hand, this time i get this amazing opportunity but i can't because I have to travel and get my meds in under 2 weeks. so what I am hoping for is that there is a possibility keep this amazing price and order in a month</pre>

For all the lumen, decibel and VAT guys, you can easily wait until retail, get all the specs, even try it before you buy it.

            <pre>Hello! I'm trying to find a single solution for the all recharging. I think nowadays it's insane to have seven different chargers if you can manage with only one. Lot of companies are actually selling products without the charger because the fact that we already have one (or seven) at home and the environmental impact.

So I will try again, what is the watt requirement for the charger to be able to charge and use the projector at the same time? Do you think my Anker will do the job?

Thanks!</pre>

One question regarding VAT:
I have bought this projector for my business for presentations.
When you buy stuff for business within the EU you don’t get charged the VAT when you provide your VAT number. I would like to also make this applicable with this purchase. What do I do?

Will it charge when projector is connected to power source or even when not connected? Will it drain the projectors battery if it charges devices when not connected power source?

            ⤷ Philips Projection : <span class="time">15 days ago</span>
            <pre>Hello, unfortunately we won't change the color nor finish. The PicoPix Max is part of the PicoPix Collection which is black. Premium appealing, colors and finish is really tough to choose and everyone can have a different opinion. We made several survey about the color of our product and that's why we chose this one.</pre>
            ⤷ lukesavvides : <span class="time">15 days ago</span>
            <pre>OK colour i understand, but all of your other picopix projectors are matte plastic which is much much more resistant to scratches and fingerprints. So the choice of the glossy finish doesn't make much sense because it will be scratched very easily. Don't you agree?</pre>
            ⤷ lukesavvides : <span class="time">15 days ago</span>
            <pre>Actually your picipix range are all different, some matte, some glossy, some white, some black.</pre>
            ⤷ Philips Projection : <span class="time">15 days ago</span>
            <pre>Hello, not at all, all the PicoPix Nano, Micro and Max have the exact same design language, colors and finish</pre>
            ⤷ lukesavvides : <span class="time">15 days ago</span>
            <pre>Yes I agree those 3 are the same, but the other picopix products (PicoPix Mobile, PicoPix pocket) are different. I understand the logic of creating a standard design across the range, but given these are portable, they will be put in bags and moved much more often then a normal projector which means they are subject to scratching a fingerprints a lot more. so either the finish should be made more durable, i.e. matte finish, or perhaps release a protective skin for it to protect it. </pre>
            ⤷ lukesavvides : <span class="time">15 days ago</span>
            <pre>Otherwise if it starts picking up scratches, it makes the Philips branding look bad because other people who see it covered in scratches will be put off buying a philips product because they can see it can be damaged easily.</pre>

I am, for one, already more than happy by saving 400€ on this fascinating product, what is the need to lie?</pre>

We know that this product is great, kudos to Philips! What we are saying is that from the very beginning of this campaign we were told that the noise level is around 30dB. Even with the update Philips claimed that it is less noisy with the new engine and said "we re still on it, but should be lower than 30db" and out of a sudden it is 38dBa (not 38dB) which is almost twice as high as the claimed 30dB!</pre>

800 lumen vs 200, and 1080p vs 720p, the philips has almost x5 the lumen and x2 the resolution, how do you expect to cool components ? Blowing air on it yourself ?
Either you are trolling or you don't any idea of the leap this product is compare to the one you talk about, even if final product end up at 38db its quieter than a pc.
They could have made a quieter product but maybe for x2 the price, and then no one would buy it.
This is a win for everyone, and mostly for customer.</pre>

You will almost certainly always be adding your own noise on top of that with whatever media you are using your projector for, and if you say I will be using it for presentations then you own human voice will power over whatever fan noise their is. Quit making mountains out of mole hills people.</pre>

ANSI Lumens only talks about "White Brightness". Color Lumens (IDMS Standard) will help measure "Red-Green-Blue Brightness" which is more realistic.

So @Philips - Can you please help separately provide, 1) what currently is the "White Lumens" and 2)what currently is the "Color Lumens" rating on this projector ? (before light engine change)</pre>

In past three weeks  Philips themselfes stated: „we are aiming below 30 dB(A) and we are near,“ 38 dB(A) is not near. It is three times more, thus dB(A) is measured logarithmical.</pre>

Go buy a good decibel meter to be sure.

Don't wanna be petulant, but are you making fun of us backers now? Fan noise, 30db was it, now it is 38db? Avoiding "tough" questions. Not answering the customs clearance cost for backers with free shipping. Stretching shipping date. I would appreciate a clear spec sheet now considering shipping mid or ultimo november, thanks!</pre>

            <pre>It is not about the VAT, it's about the customs clearance cost, the additional fee the shipping company charges you for paying the vat in advance. Often that fee is as much as the VAT itself. You have replied before that you should contact the logistics team of yours and get an answer. As far as I know that question still has not been answered.</pre>
            ⤷ Stig Petersheim : <span class="time">16 days ago</span>
            <pre>For me free shipping is product price + VAT and no additional cost. That's the reason why I ask "is free shipping including the customs clearance cost".</pre>

            class="comment">@Philips Projection , previously you said that fan noise is under 30db, and now you say it is 38dba !?!?! So what is it? If it is 38dba I think that is quite a lot, isn't it? Are those 38 dba on the old engine or on the new one? If this is old, can we expect significantly lower value for the new engine like really go under 30 or not that much?</pre>

With Android TV, you cannot sideload Netflix and you need to have a Netflix certification which happen only if you sell more than 500K units. More Over, Android OS is more versatile and the majority of our backers said they wanted Android OS.</pre>

Hello, this is our target!“

Erm, no this is not the target!
You went from shipping at the end of october to (2-4 weeks delay) shipping mid to end of november. So now we now you will delay the release even further and no real world review in sight, probably not gonna happen till the end of the campaign.

Subtracting 31 dBA from 38 dBA would give you about 37 dBA of noise from the projector.

You could celebrate your 11k backers designing a 3D printable base to hold the projector vertically (ceiling projection) with underneath space for power cable.
Then we can download and print it from Thingiverse or so. ;)

Hello, we already answered this topic many times. We've always had a particular number of units earmarked for lower price tiers. Because Philips is a worldwide company, based off of the geos we're driving to the page via various email placements, we will add to this number based on our projections. It's only fair that we keep these prices to ensure that our waitlist subscribers in those geos have access. However, one shouldn't assume that t</pre>

And a lens cap can be 3D printed as well. Being recessed doesn't guarantee it won't get scratched especially being portable.

Besides that, really appreciate the hard work! It's so good to see this projector shaping up to be one of the best portable and even main projectors.</pre>

"It is mentioned that the projector is cable of downscaling 4K to 1080P. When this is done are Croma Supsampling principel used? For instance downscaling 4K 4:2:0 content to 1080P 4:4:4, which will give downscaled 4K content a better quality than regular 1080P 4:2:0 content?"

For other backers, you can check this video, which gives a good exlanation of the topic https://youtu.be/kIf9h2Gkm_U

Will I be able to turn on and off the PicoPix Max by IFTTT and start a defined App like Weather. Use case would be to have like a Wake-up scene in the morning. Turning on the PicoPix Max starting the Weather Live App.

@Philips Team - Few things that I request your clarification/corrections.
1)Please match the Story &amp; FAQ with the updates from Oct 4th. So that new customers can get correct info and decide to back you.
2)Story states ANSI Color lumens; FAQ states Color lumens. Clarify if "800 color lumens" is as per ICDM-IDMS standards ?
3)Pls share the color lumens as per IDMS standards ASAP.
4)Pls share the color accuracy value ASAP.</pre>

            ⤷ Prabz Hn : <span class="time">19 days ago</span>
            <pre>Hi @Philips - 1)Story &amp; FAQ tabs are not updated with info from 4th Oct.Can u update ASAP?
2)Story tab shows 800 ANSI Color Lumens &amp; FAQ tab shows 800 color lumens.Confusing! It can either be 800 ANSI or 800 Color (CLO),can't be both!Refer here www.colorlightoutput.com cross-check with tech team &amp; answer to all of us.It makes a big difference to all of us so pls be true.
ANSI only measures white light output. IDMS-CLO measures color light output.
3) What's the color accuracy?Please confirm ASAP.</pre>

Will there be any problems/delay regarding the 50 - 60hz signal diff between Europe and USA broadcasting? “Apple TV” sorted it out by “auto matching”  frame rates when switching from netflix app (60hz) to local streaming tv apps (50hz)

Could it be that you just want to sell more projectors and because of THAT the shipping will be delayed? Ist looks exactly like that. There are still no reviews of Youtubers or other People, there are no new Videos as you promised or infos about how bright it really is now, and so on. Yes we are only backers and this could be a nice product, but we want more than promises,...</pre>

            class="comment">⚠️ ? QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THIS CAMPAIGN WORKS ? ⚠️

Hello Philips!

I note a strange phenomenon that I have been observing for the past few days and that deserves clarification from you:
The number of perks varies between 6 and 9 without ever going above or below while the number of backers has increased considerably, is this a strategy to sell as many aircraft as possible in the last few days by putting pressure on the fact that there are not many left where there is a rational explanation?</pre>
        <div class="replies">
            ⤷ Samuel Molteni : <span class="time">20 days ago</span>
            <pre>Because if we’re rational, there shouldn’t be one left now?
Even if several buyers have asked for a refund, it is still unlikely that the number will always fluctuate between 6 and 9 with an increasing number of backers...
</pre>
            ⤷ Samuel Molteni : <span class="time">20 days ago</span>
            <pre>For example if I record here the evolution we notice (FRENCH HOUR GMT+1)
at 22:23:: 10 569 backers "Only 9 left" (before i buy one)
at 22:39:: 10 570 backers "Only 8 left"
at 22:45:: 10 571 backers "Only 7 left"
at 23:51:: 10,588 backers "Only 8 left"
at 00:13:: 10 594 backers "Only 8 left"
at 00:48:: 10 595 backers "Only 7 left"
at 01:37:: 10 604 backers "Only 7 left"
at 01:45:: 10 605 backers "Only 8 left" (+ "10 days left" message)
at 04:38:: 10 616 backers "Only 8 left"</pre>
            ⤷ Samuel Molteni : <span class="time">20 days ago</span>
            <pre>In this one loop, it rotates between 9 and 7 continuously. (9,8,7 &gt; 9,8,7 &gt; ...)

Is it an Indiegogo tool that offers you to automatically do ca on your campaign to maximize sales by putting pressure on new visitors?

This is very surprising about a crownfunding campaign, we are entitled to wonder if we can trust you?

I’m not criticizing the projector that looks good, but I have doubts about your sharing with Indiegogo and how your campaign works, and I don’t think I’m the only one.</pre>

            <pre>Hello, we already answered this topic many times. We've always had a particular number of units earmarked for lower price tiers. Because Philips is a worldwide company, based off of the geos we're driving to the page via various email placements, we will add to this number based on our projections. It's only fair that we keep these prices to ensure that our waitlist subscribers in those geos have access. However, one shouldn't assume that these will last forever. Backing now is the only way to l</pre>
            ⤷ Samuel Molteni : <span class="time">20 days ago</span>
            <pre>Hello,
This does not explain why the number always turns between 9 and 7 (or 6), either you have a defined quantity and you display it (e.g.:200), or you produce infinity and you display a very high maximum number, or that there is no limit.
This is purely a commercial technique on a crownfunding campaign, to make potential buyers believe that there are very few left, whereas in reality, since you’ve posted this very low number of remaining units,</pre>
            ⤷ Samuel Molteni : <span class="time">20 days ago</span>
            <pre>he sold hundreds of them (which doesn’t match your explanation).

Not very honest all that.

I don’t see how every hour someone from Philips can be behind his screen adding 2 more projectors in the availabilities to always adjust between 9 and 6 remaining units.
Your answer is not convincing on that point.</pre>

Philips replied and said : "Hello, yes!"

@Philips...are you sure this will work? In fact, can you guarantee this? Do you fully understand Giorgio Zoja's original question below?

If you are confident about this, then it's a feasible solution for outputting a digital audio signal - at the very least digital stereo audio. In fact, there's no need for optical or arc in this scenario.

You say, "USB-C will also be able to charge your device at the same time".

Is there any way to turn this off? I no desire to use this as a charging station. I would prefer to guard my projector from unnecessary drainage, since the battery only lasts 3 hours to begin with and has such a short life expectancy.

Is a new DLP chip beeing used ? Or a new DMD ?

Did you come up with those 20% from the new chip's specs ?

Just FYI, brightness is not that important to me, I would very much prefer if you keep the best contrast / color chip from both.</pre>

            <pre>Typing September (which was "corrected" after several weeks!) instead of October is no typo. So you can not confirm/assure that the projector will be delivered in november? I´ve asked several times if there will be a delay - even one day before you posted the update you told a lot of people here that there will be no delay. Sorry, but i needed the product asap - please tell the people a fixed date where you´ll deliver the product, this is not a good business practice. </pre>

We are currently checking the new brightness, but it will be higher than the one we show you on video!"

I have very mixed feelings on the update. 20% more brightness of what? The promised 800 ANSI lumen or 20% more than seen until now? 

To be honest almost nothing of the update is totaly new. Bluetooth was already changed to 5.0 weeks ago. Most changes are related to the software. So the reason for delay are almost given by delay in roadmap, not new technique.</pre>

Is there a reason why you ship in Europe from CH? As CH is not part of EU (European Union) import costs are very high (for me around 100,- ex, if they apply, add carrier costs)
While within EU there are no taxes payed!

This update is fantastic.
I'd like to mention to the great development team that I'm happy to wait the right time, for example 1-2 months more, if they are willing to work on finalising this amazing product and adding, refining or shaping better some more features

For the rest of the people here, would you also agree on this? I think they are working hard and that'll benefit the product we'll get, and who cares if it's just 10 films ahead of November? :)

            <pre>My personal interests on update would be (in order of importance):
- A great Audio system for what the size allows - Why is this important? Because I'd like to avoid buying a bluetooth set that needs pairing, attentione, recharge, etc - For example Nebula 2 has a more than acceptable audio, could you compare? - better if 3D/360°
- Less HDMI latency if obtainable
- Great importance in reducing bluetooth latency (Imagine playing precise games, for example rhythm games, and being 200ms ahead)
- bag</pre>

Bluetooth Latency reduction 4. if possible, a carrying bag would be nice, being natively a portable solutions - - - - Feel free, users, to add your thoughts</pre>

Can you please answer my question directly:
1. Can I refund from Indiegogo after 05.10? I’m not askin instructions, I’m asking if it’s possible after this date?
2. How have you come up with 20% brightness increase if you haven’t measured it? We would like to know brightness and noise values.

            class="comment">@ carljohan selke When import something from another country, you need to pay import duties &amp; taxes, and sometimes, admin fees. In our case, we need to pay extra VAT (which is tax). Technically, things from another EU country do not subject to duties (0-20%); however, it's so rare that the price of the product bought in EU does not contain VAT, so I'm also not sure whether paying duty is required or not. Last but not least, not sure whether there is admin fees in Sweden.</pre>

I am quite happy with the shipment delay, in exchange for the additional improvements, and getting everything right.  

The new shipment delay will cause a small delivery logistics problem for me (traveling overseas for 1 month during that time), but I am confident that we can work something out once the actual shipment dates/ details are known!</pre>

I cannot by any means accept any delay in shipping.  

We signed up in August hoping to get our hands on the device by October. 

These upgrades DO NOT matter to the majority of the people who signed up and supported the campaign in August. 
We did not ask for all this. It's a breach of trust.

I wish Philips would stick to their schedule and deliver what they promised. 
If the unexpected demand is the reason you can't meet the schedule pls tell us that.</pre>

As Mr.Erman Akkaya has said in a comment, we'll wait a couple of weeks more for a trouble-free ,upgraded, future ready product.

And especially since you're so close to 10000% of your goal, it's fair that you take some time to make history. 

Philips, don't break our hearts. 

No more extending the delivery please. Please keep this schedule. </pre>

Honestly the 15-20 day delay is not a fine considering addition of those features listed.

- but you will need a 65watts powerbank to be able to charge and maintain the projector on.
With the solution 1, your powerbank will still charge the PicoPix Max battery, but the built-in battery will power the projector. In the solution 2, the powerbank will charge AND power the projector</pre>

If you have ever back a project you would know sometimes there can be delays; a delay of a review is nothing to get upset about, besides, it sounds as though they want to get this product right. And Philips has gone out of their way to try and create an amazing product worth waiting for. Personally, I'm just trying to contain my excitement.</pre>

Therefore, most of the ladder correction is automatic vertical, but PicoPix Max is automatic horizontal correction. Does this mean that there is a lot Large chances must be manually corrected?

I think would be possible to implement similar feature at software level in "our" projector.
It would be great example of synergie between different department.

I guess that is great for the company to make it work only with the Philips smart home hub but does it mean the we who own other kind ot smart home already will have to throw it away or have PicoPix unconnected with the smarthome even though it has the needed hardware? 2. My cable company has it's own Android app for IPTV and I hope that I'll be able to install it on PicoPix so an option to send the Android system sound directly to Sonos would be great.

As you introduced the battery bypass system will it work even if the battery is removed and projector is directly plugged in.?

It would be very useful if you could put up, rather ask your shipping company to give a list of the extra amount that we would have to pay as a separate FAQ or update in your front page."

I second this. A lot of questions and apprehensions regarding extra charges.

1. Can the device use AirPlay for audio out? (HomePod specifically)
2. Have you tested it with Disney+ (I'm sure you have some contacts in The Netherlands where it's out, or you can use ExpressVPN)
3. Is shipping still on track? (Last two questions because of The Mandalorian)

Thanks, G.</pre>

            <pre>Hello
1: No you cannot send sound from the projector to Airplay. This is only to receive Airplay 
2: Disney+: we tried but can't access the trial for the moment. We cannot test it for the moment. It should work if they coded it for Android 9
3: yes</pre>

            <pre>Hello, 
Charging can be done with any charger and any voltage as the USB-C will ask the power support to the charger. But if you use a charger that is lower than 67watts, the battery will still charge, slowly and the battery will keep deliver power to the projector. The other solution is to shut down the projector, and charge the battery with any powerbank or charger.</pre>

You (Philips) stated multiple times that there is no delay when using BT speakers. How is this possible? In my understanding, there is always a delay with BT speakers, even the better codecs like the AptX LL have a (small) delay. What happens if I use older BT speakers like JBL Extreme (BT4.1/SBC)? The latency with these is usually 150 - 225ms and that's not suitable for Netflix etc. If I stereo pair, it gets even worse. Could the OS include a delay compensation?</pre>

            class="comment">@Amar Soman, conditions of perk mention that Import duty will be covered. However from experience here in UAE, DHL normally charges Customer additional fee every time VAT is charged. Like an administration fee, which circa 30 USD. @Philips, I raised this earlier as well and you mentioned that you will check matter internally.  Please confirm that I pay VAT only and other duties/DHL charges will not be applicable/will not be charged. I.e. confirm that in UAE I will be charged 5% only (VAT) thanks</pre>

In that case I'm afraid, it would be better to wait for Philips to market the product the conventional way. I do not think they'd price it any more than 40k. 

Simply put, i'm forced to think it might be stupid to pre-order.</pre>

            class="comment">Thanks for posting the videos. I truly cannot wait to receive my unit!

But watching your video demo of the Netflix app, it appears that the video projected is using some sort of motion interpolation processing preset? I understand if this was used for the video demonstration as recorded smartphone video would give a unflattering, flickering display for 24fps footage but I hope that the motion smoothing preset is switched to OFF by default. I want to watch movies, not soap operas ;)</pre>

            ⤷ Tomislav Subjak : <span class="time">26 days ago</span>
            <pre>Thank for the reply! But shooting 4K @60fps does not create motion smoothing that the Netflix show was displaying.

I shot a test with this video I found on YT with my camera in 4K @60fps, and you can still see the difference as you do in the video between the real 24fps version and the motion smoothing version - https://youtu.be/SPZXR4sxfRc

I'm hyped for this product and I want it to be the best, delivering motion options. Look forward to seeing the PicoPix Max projector settings video clip! </pre>

It is mentioned that the projector is cable of downscaling 4K to 1080P. When this is done are Croma Supsampling principel used? For instance downscaling 4K 4:2:0 content to 1080P 4:4:4, which will give downscaled 4K content a better quality than regular 1080P 4:2:0 content.</pre>

A prior response said that you guys were working on making it quieter last month, were you able to make it quieter because if it's able to get picked up by the mic which seemed a couple of feet away, it must be significantly loud and potentially distracting? Just curious if you can do a video with more coverage on that issue as that's probably one of the top consumer concerns.</pre>

            <pre>Hello Joseph, as previously said, the video as been shot with an iPhone 11 and the microphone is really sensitive. As you can hear, you can even hear the click of the controller which is usually not so loud... Also the room is quite empty and makes an echo. There many parameters and that's why we don't like so much to make videos because you don't really see the image quality of the sound</pre>

This is purely related to security at the OS level.  Perfect example of this. Google announced a vulnerability, today, that gives full control of Android. As a company who is providing a device with an OS it is Philips responsibility to ensure that your system's security is maintained.  Esp if we are connecting it to the net. (Even with a VPN.)</pre>

Can you elaborate? Lumens - so ansi lumens? Vivid color? What does it mean? Picture settings? Are picture settings measured in lumens?

            <pre>Hello, 800. Cheers!</pre>
            ⤷ lukesavvides : <span class="time">28 days ago</span>
            <pre>No this is 800 colour ANSI lumens which is different to normal ANSI lumens. I want to know what is the normal ANSI lumens?</pre>
            ⤷ Philips Projection : <span class="time">28 days ago</span>
            <pre>Unfortunately, the rule that ANSI Lumens are a universal measurement of brightness for projectors is simply not the case. ANSI Lumens refers to the measurement of determining the brightness of white pixels and was adapted for lamp based projectors. Current projector technology like LED projectors with RGB-B have better color saturation and appear brighter than lamp based projectors. </pre>
            ⤷ Philips Projection : <span class="time">28 days ago</span>
            <pre>With the evolution of both the content that we watch and the projectors themselves, standard ANSI Lumens are now obsolete. 
We compared a dozen of projectors advertising 1000 "ANSI LUMENS" and found out that the visible brightness was not the same. A precise measurement shown that the difference between advertised ANSI and the reality was, in some cases more than 54%.</pre>
            ⤷ Philips Projection : <span class="time">28 days ago</span>
            <pre>We are using the term Color Lumens which better describes how bright the image will actually look. Essentially, Color Lumens = Lumens + Vivid Color + Fine Tuned Picture Settings. So 800.</pre>
            ⤷ lukesavvides : <span class="time">28 days ago</span>
            <pre>In this case, do you have a figure for the brightness of the white pixels so we can compare to lamp based projectors? It gives a better comparison than 'Color Lumens' because noone else in the industry uses this. Thanks</pre>
            ⤷ Philips Projection : <span class="time">28 days ago</span>
            <pre>Hello, we don't give such data, we only communicate on the Lumens which is the industry standard. 800 lumens would be comparable to 800 lumens.</pre>
            ⤷ lukesavvides : <span class="time">28 days ago</span>
            <pre>OK thanks, I hope it is comparable to 800 ansi lumens of white pixels!!</pre>

        <pre class="comment">Hello Philips!
Glad to see that!
So, please, take a a particulary care about color deviation.
In past PicoPix, the DeltaE was bad at 11 !(several Pro reviewer note that, like "Les Numériques" in France).
Here, the Red an Green seem over- saturated, is it a particular setting like "vivid" or the main setting?
Please try to have  good calibrated natural colors direct out of the box, it's very important for a projector, and after, the possibility in settings to slightly adjust them...
Gamma too:)</pre>

You announced your partnership with ExpressVPN quite proudly and as something special for PicoPix users. This is not special at all. ExpressVPN offers 3 extra months free VPN to anyone who subscribes for 12 months. It seems that this is a totally commercial thing with some benefits for Philips but not the users.

Audiodelay shouldn't be the function: you'd need Videodelay. That would make it possible to sync with an audiodelay caused at the receiving Bluetooth adapter.
But I don't know if every Video app, like MX or VLC would support that. Good development idea though.</pre>

Why are you comparing a price excl tax €439 with a price incl tax €899  is isn't legal ??

Just conducted a small experement with my Android phone paired to this adapter and placed about 30 feet away from it. When playing a Netflix movie, there seemed to be perfect lipsync with no perceptable audio lag. I think it is fair to assume same will be the case with the PPMax.

Basically a software audio slider to either delays or advances the audio output, so that if we use a Bluetooth speaker and there is an audio delay, we can adjust to sync. This would address all the comments below about audio delay. Also, not all Bluetooth speakers are the same, some speakers naturally have a delay. Could be a software update down the line.</pre>

I’m hoping to feed my Apple TV box into the amp, via HDMI in, and then HDMI out to the projector; so audio through the surround speakers and visuals through the projector. Is this possible?
This is probably a very basic/naive question, but I’ve never owned a projector before, and after searching about ARC I’m confused!

I know that some people wants the projector as soon as possible (I also want), but this feature will make our projector much more versatile. For people that just want the mobility this won't make difference, but for people that wants a better audio this will be excelent.

So, if the hardware in the Max is already capable of ARC and it is just a matter of software / driver tweaking, then I am all for it, as it would not need to lead to a delay, as the capability could come in the form of a software update.

I would be happy with that.</pre>

 I do have  Two questions, as is on Android :
1. is there microfon bild in? (if yes question no. 2)
2. it will suport Google assistant, chrome cast or any...?

 I think if is portable device with Android it will be logic to be abell have voice control or voice control thru the connected phone.
 Stend by mode? to be able activate device with voice or thru the connected phone (if supported).</pre>

Haw you probably know you don't wake up any off smart bulbs directly is up to G Assistant to do so for you. It's will be nice to have it set up to wake you up on morning showing sea on your wall or wok to the kitchen on morning and ask your smart home to show news on kitchen wall....</pre>

Can we activate projector with HDMI signal, as all TV do it? or start casting to it to activate?

So as @Saji Gopi says thoroughly testing and fixing bugs and issues is the preferable road in my opinion.

For all the impatient people, surely you’d prefer a better product that’s going to last you years, rather than just getting it a little bit quicker. 
Philips if you can implement ARC and any audio enhancements I’m all for it. You’ll end up with a far more superior product and it will be worth it in the long run. </pre>

15 hours ago they said “ Great news! We have received the PicoPix Max packaging and we will get some shots tonight along with the video showing Youtube, APTOIDE store and Netflix.”
After doing that it takes time to edit, pass internal reviews, then post.  So it could easily be another day or so to actually see the video.</pre>

This is from decades of product development and engineering experience, and these days with the instant and explosive atmosphere of the internet I’d be careful to shoot video and post to minimise the many dangers of getting inaccurate footage due to shutter angle, frame rate, and scan speed interacting with a video projector picture which is then converted by Indiegogo, YouTube, Facebook to be displayed on a huge range of different mobile phones, tablets, computers.</pre>

My use cases are for camping, travelling, for watching in the bedroom where we have no TV and for watching outside on our balcony.  For audio, I will use internal speakers, Bluetooth headphones (especially now I can use two! Thanks!) or Bluetooth speakers.  Connecting to a 5.1 system is much better served by a non-portable projector.</pre>

Arc has is not paramout in a portable pico projector, even on the business side if you use it for presentation.
First if you use it that mean there is no tv or videoprojector in the room.
Second since there isnt a videoprojector i don't think they will be a arc soundsystem</pre>

I've owned many portable projectors, I've yet to see one lasting more than 5 years, from respectable brands or not, even if LED are advertised as 30 years.
They never last 30 years, even in big projectors.
They NEVER last long in such small products, mainly because of the heat generated.</pre>

        <pre class="comment">@Will Plaister thank you for the helpful input. I guess my final question is a silly one but if Arc is supported by the projector. How would I connect the projector to the Yamaha. I thought the project needed to have an HDMI out in order to connect to the sound source? Unless I'm missing the point and that's what Arc would provide if Philips are able to enable it.

The PicoPix Max will be a better Product if it gets ARC!
I will use it most of the time at Home with a DTS Receiver and mobile with a ARC Soundbar!
So it is for me the only way to use it with HDMI ARC!
A spdif or optical out would have been nice!
I just thought bluetooth would be enough but HDMI ARC makes sense and sorry to say: OPTICAL OUT would be great too!</pre>

This could very well become the perfect little portable projector!
I've been very impressed so far, and appreciate you listening and considering all we've said.

        <pre class="comment">Hello Team! 
Thank you for your efforts! A few questions:
1. Are you still implementing Widevine L1? Is there this possibility that you don't manage to implement it? 
2. About the noise, I am excited about your video that you are going to upload soon, but still some measurements and numbers would be great. 
3. I know that we can cast video/audio via Chromecast or Airplay on the device, but is this possible to cast the sound from the device to a speaker, using google home app and via WiFi?

            class="comment">Is ARC a physical change or a protocol? Maybe the pcba already supports arc as it's hdmi 1.4 compliant. Software update perhaps? 
Also, just read somewhere that ARC can't decode HD formats like dts master, dolby HD, dts x or dolby atmos. In this sense, it's the exactly the same as optical which is only capable of the old dolby and dts formats. eArc on the other hand...:P
Some form of digital output aside from BT is good for future-proofing. Who knows how we'll connect picopix in the future!?</pre>

        <pre class="comment">@ Matthew Rose. I've owned a few Yamaha receivers over the journey too, they just don't die! Haha!
So I quickly checked and the RXV367 does support arc so IF they include this feature you'd get 5.1 surround from any source (apple tv, bluray, set top box) and you'd also get 5.1 surround from any app that supports and outputs dts/dolby etc. - Netflix, Plex, Kodi, VLC, sports apps and so on :)

Cheers,
Will</pre>

You need to define rules (ie. 51% wins is a bad way to do it, we all heard about the Brexit) and to ensure that the pool will be transparent. Also a big majority signed here because it is labeled "Philips" and we can be sure we will have something at the defined time because there is trust. If you start messing up with rules, It is Philips brand that you're putting into play.</pre>

            class="comment">Thanks @Will Plaister , that's helpful. It's an old model that may not support what's needed. RX-V367 , had it years but has served me well but perhaps time for an upgrade if I can't get the solution I need to work with the projector. 

Yes it makes sense re connecting sources to AV then HDMI out to projector but I guess then I'm limited with the sources and I'll mainly be using netflix so a bit stumped here. If implemented how would ARC help in my situation? Cheers Will</pre>

            class="comment">@Matthew Rose. I dunno, I personally wouldn't connect directly the bd player to the projector as Philips have recommended below. I would connect your sources (bluray, Apple TV etc.) directly to the Yamaha AVR. Then 'hdmi out' to the projector. Some AVRs have dual hdmi outputs so you could connect 1 to TV and 1 to the picopix max without having to manually change hdmi cables when you switch between tv/projctor. As far as I know the audio delay would be minute. Philips say delay is 30ms on hdmi.</pre>

            ⤷ Will Plaister : <span class="time">30 days ago</span>
            <pre>Also, what's your Yamaha model number?
By connecting all your sources directly to an AVR you ensure IT takes care of the HD audio decoding (5.1/7.1/Atmos etc.) and simply 'passes' the video through to the TV or projector.
Make sense?</pre>

I think you should recognize this as huge development failure, despite being portable, stereo sound is not enough for every ear :)</pre>

        <pre class="comment">Agree that Optical or ARC would be great. I'll be using the projector in my lounge that has audio setup through an amp, I'm not an expert here but I don't believe I can connect the projector to the amp to utilise the existing setup.

Other than that, super excited to receive this product and I think the team do a great job of engaging with the community here.

            <pre>From what I have been able to verify, Philips makes use of JmGO hardware (Screeneo S6 = JmGO X3), Philips basically modifies the firmware according to its "needs". Screeneo costs about $ 1799, JmGO about $ 1100.
What I mean and I am fearing is that I will receive a projector, supposedly Philips that is actually from a Chinese manufacturer and a month is € 200 cheaper on Aliexpress.
That if Screeneo S6 indicates 2000 color lumens, Jmgo X3 indicates 1500 ANSI lumens, it does not seem so complicate</pre>

Some people disagree with their assessment of the brightness of the color apparently.  It only measures the brightness in the colors red, green and blue leaves aside the 6 colors that exist in DLP technology (red, green, blue, cyan, yellow and white or magenta).

If I'm right, it sounds a lot like pixel shifting to me =)
"Pixel array size is 1368 columns by 768 rows in a square grid pixel arrangement. The fast switching speed of the DMD micromirrors combined with advanced DLP image processing algorithms enables each micromirror to display two distinct pixels on the screen during every frame, resulting in a full 1920 x 1080 pixel image being displayed."</pre>

            <pre>Unfortunately, the rule that ANSI Lumens are a universal measurement of brightness for projectors is simply not the case. ANSI Lumens refers to the measurement of determining the brightness of white pixels and was adapted for lamp based projectors. Current projector technology like LED projectors with RGB-B have better color saturation and appear brighter than lamp based projectors. </pre>
            ⤷ Philips Projection : <span class="time">1 month ago</span>
            <pre>With the evolution of both the content that we watch and the projectors themselves, standard ANSI Lumens are now obsolete. 
We compared a dozen of projectors advertising 1000 "ANSI LUMENS" and found out that the visible brightness was not the same. A precise measurement shown that the difference between advertised ANSI and the reality was, in some cases more than 54%.</pre>

        <pre class="comment">You stated that we can return it during 30 days after receiving.
Will you also refund VAT then ? I ask since this is not a pre-sale but a "partnership" to get around law.

I also ask, because the video provided shows massive sync problem while BT is not in use (how come is that even possible, I wonder), and a really loud fan noise. 
Your assertion of 27dB @1m (is this dBA SPL ?) also seems way too low to be credible.

Hope you guys can provide a better demo experience before campaign ends !</pre>

1: we are not collecting the Vat but the shipping company does it, you will need to ask them the vat back 
2: we have 23db on have Screeneo U3, so everything is possible :) </pre>
            ⤷ LEGRET Nicolas : <span class="time">1 month ago</span>
            <pre>Ok, so VAT is lost in case of refund, thanks for clarifying that !

Screeneo U3 is huge compared to picopix max, so it may be possible using a largely wider case ;)
anyway, it's advertised at 25dB and measured by reviewers around 32dB (@ full brightness).
That number seems a lot more realistic, since most room's ambient noise can be measured around 28/30dB ;)</pre>
            ⤷ LEGRET Nicolas : <span class="time">1 month ago</span>
            <pre>Well, I know I won't get realistic values for noise level, brightness, and contrast ratio, this is common practice in the display industry, unfortunately.
We'll need to wait for reviews to see the real numbers, but campaign ends in 15 days and I doubt we'll get independent reviews before that date.

Too bad, just have to take the bet I guess !
Hope you can make it real quieter =)</pre>

Of course it will be a different experience comparing to actually seeing it in person, and it might very well not reflect the actual thing, but it still is great to see them in action and it certainly looks very promising.

If the brightness is at 75% here then we can expect even more heat dissipation at 100% and so a fan spinning even faster. A small beamer is rarely a great idea when you take this into consideration.</pre>

The videos look great however I notice the audio is massively out of sync with the video. I’m sure this is not due to the recording from your phone. 
Is the video streamed from the internet? Mirrored from a phone/laptop? Or direct from USB/micro sd?
Is the sound direct from the PicoPix or bluetooth to an external speaker?

Maybe I can shed some light as to whats capable on android os.
For your second question, it would be possible without a doubt.
File managers can be installed and used as servers on both andriod and pc/macbook. If the OS doesnt have something built in already, youll be able to install a simple app on the store to make that possible.
and for your forth question, android natively supports keyboard and mouse
Netflix offline should absolutely work.

though hopefully support can help.</pre>

Clearly, with the "Color Lumens = Lumens + Vivid Color + Fine Tuned Picture Settings", this means the standard "ANSI Lumens" may be less than 800, but the overall viewing quality will be better than what you might think of say "600 ANSI Lumens".

Nevertheless, for those who need a visual explanation, the view "Same measured brightness" / "Same perceived brightness" and, more, the parallel pictures of 2200 ANSI Lumens lamp projector and 900 ANSI Lumens LED projector are very pertinent to explain what you mean when you say "Lumens + Vivid Color + Fine Tuned Picture Settings".</pre>

“Color lumen” is some new term you introduce which is different metric from “industry standard”, which is ‘ANSI lumens’. ‘ANSI lumens’ is metric quoted by most manufacturers including Texas Instruments, who provide chips for the whole industry.

            <pre>Hello Riku, Unfortunately, the rule that ANSI Lumens are a universal measurement of brightness for projectors is simply not the case. ANSI Lumens refers to the measurement of determining the brightness of white pixels and was adapted for lamp based projectors. Current projector technology like LED projectors with RGB-B have better color saturation and appear brighter than lamp based projectors.
</pre>
            ⤷ Philips Projection : <span class="time">1 month ago</span>
            <pre>With the evolution of both the content that we watch and the projectors themselves, standard ANSI Lumens are now obsolete. 
We compared a dozen of projectors advertising 1000 "ANSI LUMENS" and found out that the visible brightness was not the same. A precise measurement shown that the difference between advertised ANSI and the reality was, in some cases more than 54%.</pre>
            ⤷ Philips Projection : <span class="time">1 month ago</span>
            <pre>We are using the term Color Lumens which better describes how bright the image will actually look. Essentially, Color Lumens = Lumens + Vivid Color + Fine Tuned Picture Settings</pre>

i've just contribute this day for this PicoPix Max, i'm waiting for it eagerly!
I read that bluetooth module is not Aptx, so certainly(perhaps) no low latency.
For me, a low latency BT is needed to watch a film with a bluetooth speaker, otherwise there is a lag between the image and the sound in this movie.
Do you work on this latency problem, because some of them will use this feature to send sound towards BT speakers...?

You don't get such a withdrawal right when you buy from Aliexpress either, for example. This has nothing to do with VAT.
VAT is collected by the delivery service and transferred to the fiscal authorities of the country where you live; Philips has nothing to do with this at all.</pre>

Regardless of who collects the VAT (you or the courier), when I pay the VAT, at least here in Germany, it means that I am purchasing the product and therefore I am covered by the withdrawal rights, which means that I can send back the product within 14 days of the receiving date without any reason given.

1: chromecast feature will come in a future update
2: you can already do screen mirroring with Android or Airplay
3: APTOIDE worls exactly like the PLaystore but it will show only apps that are compatible for landscape display like a projector
4: FOTA updated via Wi-Fi but we won't upgrade to Android 10 or 11 as there is not point to get such feature on a projector. Between Android 6 or 10, you won't see the difference as we have our own launcher.

            ⤷ Philips Projection : <span class="time">1 month ago</span>
            <pre>Unfortunately, the rule that ANSI Lumens are a universal measurement of brightness for projectors is simply not the case. ANSI Lumens refers to the measurement of determining the brightness of white pixels and was adapted for lamp based projectors. Current projector technology like LED projectors with RGB-B have better color saturation and appear brighter than lamp based projectors. </pre>
            ⤷ Philips Projection : <span class="time">1 month ago</span>
            <pre>With the evolution of both the content that we watch and the projectors themselves, standard ANSI Lumens are now obsolete. 
We compared a dozen of projectors advertising 1000 "ANSI LUMENS" and found out that the visible brightness was not the same. A precise measurement shown that the difference between advertised ANSI and the reality was, in some cases more than 54%. We are using the term Color Lumens which better describes how bright the image will actually look. </pre>
            ⤷ Philips Projection : <span class="time">1 month ago</span>
            <pre>Essentially, Color Lumens = Lumens + Vivid Color + Fine Tuned Picture Settings."</pre>

We will see after Philips' measuring, but for me the best response is that the size of the image is not 250" but 150", which needs to be displayed the exact distance you announced : 4 meters (157,5" with the 1.05 ratio).
For a 250" image in 16:9, you need a wall 3,55m high and 6,35m wide ...</pre>

            <pre>Ludovic, thanks for pointing out this error, it's indeed 261" distance from the wall to get 250" diagonal display. We were so excited to show this massive image that we didnt realize the distance. In any case, we do not recommend to get this big size but to stay under 120" to get the best contrast and colors.

Ludovic coorected this by pointing out that there is a 1.05 ratio between diagonal and distance (or 1.2 between width and distance) and the distance should be 6.65m
You responded that there is a formula... 
Light travels in a straight line once out of the projector. The relation is linear so it should be 6.65m
The only change is the different focus, that could zoom a little but not that much. 
Please clarify.</pre>

            <pre>Hum... I do not understand the reasoning. We see on your infographic that we get an image of 80" at a projection distance of 84", 100" at 105" and 120" at 126". So we have a factor of 1.05 between the size of the image and the distance of projection. So, as the zoom does not go beyond 100% (i.e. it can't upscale the image), for the 250" we should be at 262", or 6.65m... By this calculation, at 3.5m the image would be 3.33m, that is to say 131".</pre>
            ⤷ Philips Projection : <span class="time">1 month ago</span>

Because Philips is a worldwide company, based off of the geos we're driving to the page via various email placements, we will add to this number based on our projections.

3: yes, with 45watts
4: 2.5hours around, but still tuning it
5: we will test and get back to you
6: 16GB is for the entire system with apps, you still have the opportunity to install plenty of apps don't worry, otherwise you will need to insert a MicroSD to get a larger storage. Thanks!</pre>

            <pre>Thank you very much for the reply.
It's cool that the included remote is already an airmote but I already have a good one with a keyboard (with backlit) so I don't want to just put it in the drawer ;)

As for the storage, I am interested because all my pico projectors had this problem where apps partition is only 2 GB so it's very limited and frustrating.

And lastly, hopefully the test on the bluetooth audio output is positive because it'll be good when connecting consoles.</pre>
            ⤷ Philips Projection : <span class="time">1 month ago</span>
            <pre>Hello, if you have another Bluetooth remote, it will work as well but it needs to be HID protocol. For Storage, 3 GB or less will be allocated to the OS.</pre>

As you answered me the regular price €899 is the price witch include VAT, and the reduce price doesn't include VAT...
So you compare a price with VAT with a price without VAT to say that there is 53% OFF.
SO it isn't true it is only 44% OFF
You said me that the price without VAT is 749€.
Can you change that thanks!!!!</pre>

        <pre class="comment">In the latest update, the photos look good, but the "bright room" looks more like a "dimly lit room" to me. IFA looks like a more bright environment, but those pics/videos do not show the PicoPix Max in action, just two other projectors. Makes sense to show off the strongest projectors on the floor of course,  but that makes it difficult to judge the PicoPix Max' brightness.

Can we expect some more material of the projector in action soon, or 3rd party reviews? Thanks in advance!</pre>

But like Ming said, when I contributed to this project it said "You may request a full refund from Indiegogo until the campaign ends on October 4, 2019.", but when I look at my contribution page now it says otherwise, which is odd.  It says the only way to get a refund is by contacting you. Just wondering, if I decide that I want my money back, is there still a way to get a refund?

        <pre class="comment">Hi,
Few weeks ago it was written in your FAQ that the shipping was begining at the end of september.
Now it has changed to the end of october...

Also you said that you will send it as a gift (that is normal) so without VAT to pay and now you have changed mind and i will have to pay VAT which is 80€ more!!!

What are you going to change next?
It isn't fair</pre>
        <div class="replies">
            ⤷ Philips Projection : <span class="time">1 month ago</span>
            <pre>Hello Frank, we always answered to all backers that the shipping date will be at the end of Oct. The FAQ wasnt updated. 
Concerning the VAT, it cannot be sent as a gift, this is illegal </pre>
            ⤷ Franck Rosenstein : <span class="time">1 month ago</span>
            <pre>Hi,
In the FAQ it was written "at the end of september" .
And no it isn't illegal to send a free copy of a product to investors.

If i'm an investor on your project, i can wait the product to be finished (until end of october) and receive a free copy!!!
If i just buy the product, i'm ok to pay the VAT but respect the deadline you've put on your FAQ!
As you may know, In France it is Illegal to send a product at a price which isn't include the VAT to the end user!</pre>
            ⤷ Philips Projection : <span class="time">1 month ago</span>
            <pre>Hello Frank, I;m sorry but we won't debate again on this. This topic was closed some weeks ago. The VAT will be collected by the shipping company and we always answered that the shipping will be at the end of Oct. Have a great day!</pre>
            ⤷ Franck Rosenstein : <span class="time">1 month ago</span>
            <pre>So 
1) I've bought a product at 399€ which include VAT
2) I've invest on your project, and to thank me you've promised me to send me a free copy (as you said before)</pre>
            ⤷ Franck Rosenstein : <span class="time">1 month ago</span>
            <pre>So what you do is illegal!</pre>
            ⤷ Philips Projection : <span class="time">1 month ago</span>
            <pre>Not at all. All product on Indiegogo are sold without VAT. The VAT is not collected via Indiegogo nor us, but when the country enters inside your country. So the SHipping company will collect it to be in line with the local regulations. </pre>

            ⤷ Franck Rosenstein : <span class="time">1 month ago</span>
            <pre>Of course it is without VAT because we don't buy a product on indiegogo!!!
You should check before launching a campaign...

I've invested in few company using Indiegogo.
Sometimes we lose money because society can not achieve the product and sometime we make a good deal (like all the investment are) 
But i've never paid VAT here!!! There is no sence!</pre>
            ⤷ Philips Projection : <span class="time">1 month ago</span>
            <pre>Dear Frank, if you are not satisfied with the product or with the services, you can certainly ask for a refund. Wish you a great day!</pre>
            ⤷ Franck Rosenstein : <span class="time">1 month ago</span>
            <pre>I didn't said that i'm not satisfied with the product.
But in fact u use indiegogo to sell product and no to finance it.
Every day we can see that there is xx products left and after few hours there is more product left...
You are  cheating with us!</pre>

It could be very useful, as it's more frequent to have a coulour painted wall than a white one (even if the white is also a color ;-) ).

Why you always show static images (photographs) of the same projected image and not videos showing the operation if the product is so advanced.  Even in the IFA it was turned off and in the opposite direction to the wall that I see and the same old advertisement was shown.
Only worried about the really  brightness and the noise

I think it's time to capitalize on the huge database of questions/answers in these comments to start a very useful FAQ (2nd tab on Indiegogo page ;-) ).
As a first time backer, I'm here from the start and almost each question has been asked over 10 times!
I don't blame new backers to ask, because it's a pain to crawl over 700 comments to find aswers, but it's boring to read these over asked requests...
So, unless it's a tactic to generate traffic, please write this FAQ.

I haven't seen that because on Indiegogo there's not a badge counting articles near the "FAQ" tab, as done on Kickstarter...
Maybe you could begin all your responses by "As said in the FAQ, ...".

With the system being Android, do you think it may be possible to get an auto rotate feature similar to the announced, Acer C250i. Auto-rotate between horizontal and vertical positioning of the device.

Talking about rotating the device, the air cooling vents is it from both left and right sides, or just one of the sides?

        <pre class="comment">Hi @Phillips,

For shipping to Canada from the U.S. you mentioned maybe using DHL, as noted by James C and Johannes The, couriers like UPS and DHL are the worst when it comes to the brokerage fees that they add on top of any customs charges. FedEx is only slightly better.

I would also like to vote for USA-&gt;Canada shipping to use express shipping via US Post (which will then transfer Canada Post).

Thanks very much for update 4, really looking forward to my PicoPix Max!!</pre>

        <pre class="comment">Hi there,
In update 4 you show some pictures of it projecting at 250". I know you advertise the product as maximum 120", on bigger sizes the image quality will degrade and that is perfectly understandable. But can you focus/overrule the autofocus to project bigger than 120"? Or is it still focused for 120" thus giving a soft 250" picture (I mean focus, not due to increased pixel size). Having an even larger image, while being of lesser quality, might come in handy now and then. 
Thanks!</pre>

But maybe you missed out on my comments below: Your answer to my question regarding the lens protection is not satisfactory: Isn't it better to put a protective layer or scratch resistance on the lens or the outer glass protecting the lens. This way we can be confident and relieved that the lens or the outer glass will not be scratched. You are giving 24 months warranty, but to prevent it from happening is better I feel.</pre>

The point with IFA is to give new tech products visibility, but litteraly no one talked about the PP max at IFA, and THEY (not us) said they will post pictures on monday. So what was the point to be at IFA (if they actually went)? How can they be exhausted if they were invisible?

        <pre class="comment">So let me repeat the pros and cons :
Pros:
1080p pico projector.
800 COLOR lumens (lumens you just created and can't compare to others btw).

Cons:
-Bad speakers (too weak to watch a movie in good conditions...think about it: eyes at 1080p, ears at 2x4w? So an external bluetooth speaker becomes mandatory).
-Fan noise (?)
-No way to cast content AND do multitasking for chrome/android users (that's smart tv from 2014).

Also, 3hours battery life was for 600 lumens, how much with 800 lumens?

            <pre>Hello HB. As we say in french, the most beautiful girl/man can only offers what it has. If our PicoPix Max doesn't fit your expectation we are really sorry about this. You can be reimbursed now or even in 20 days. We have tested the projector tonight in a dark room and where really impressed about the brightness and quality. We will post pictures today or tomorrow. Have a great day!</pre>

            <pre>Thanks, I'm sure its bright and stuff, but that's not my question :)
Battery life at 800 lumens? Why no smart cast function allowing multitasking for Android/Chrome users (that's software so still manageable I guess)? Cheers</pre>
            ⤷ Philips Projection : <span class="time">1 month ago</span>
            <pre>Hello HB, the multitasking is possible on both Android and Airplay. We also support cast button so you are able to do something else on your phone. We tried is tonight. For the battery life at 800, we are still testing. Have a great evening</pre>
            ⤷ H B : <span class="time">1 month ago</span>
            <pre>Thanks for the reply. That's great news, but Android is an OS and Airplay a protocol, so I am not sure why you compare them? What protocole do you use to cast that allow multitasking for Android/chrome devices if not chromecast?

            class="comment">Acer recently announced its C250i in IFA Berlin. I was wondering if you could make a quick comparison of the specs? While the Philips perk is amazing value, the MSRP of $993 seems a little too much compared to the $489 of the C250i, given that Acer is also a reputable brand.
Considering that both the products are at IFA Berlin, a comparison would be great, it might be a big ask but given the lack of any standard brightness measurements, this is probably the only reasonable way to compare them.</pre>

Seeing their specification, this is not a smart projector With Android and their lumens are much lower than us. They use a smaller engine, less bright but with a bigger battery life. In any case we cannot compare this product to the PicoPix Max where our device is smart and with plenty of image corrections :)</pre>

It does not matter what app that we use (youtube, amazon prime, netflix) or some other video player. If the volume of the video is low, can it be amplified to 200%.

Congratz on great work!

I have three Qs:
1. How close to &amp; far from the screen can this device be placed?
2. Is there any technical reason for not using PicoPix Max to project on the ceiling (put the device in vertical position while operating for prolonged periods of time)?
3. Is it possible to get an invoice for buying PicoPix Max through Indiegogo?

Thanks

LG PF50KA retails for only $650 and is only behind by 200 lumens and softer speakers. However they provide 2 HDMI with 1 being ARC compliant, an Antenna port and also contrast ratio of 100,000:1
I don't see PicoPix Max being worth more than $700 if comparing to the current market offerings which makes this more like a 30% off instead. But it is still a good deal mind you.</pre>

The answers are always the same. 
Not sure if I have the full list. 
1. No plans for stretch goals / perks.
2. No changes to hardware, just minor improvements to fan noise, what else? 
3.No Android TV since this is custom Android OS. So dont think of built in Chromecast. 
4.Want extra space? Use MicroSD card instead.
5.Want better casing? Sorry. It means adding more costs.

</pre>
            ⤷ Philips Projection : <span class="time">2 months ago</span>
            <pre>Hello Robin, I remind you that the amount of money is due to the fact that 5214 backers joined us. The margin are very low and we offer the shipping.
We changed already the hardware by adding BT5, battery bypass, Widevine L1... 
Concerning Android TV, we explained since the beginning that Android TV is now our priority as many backers prefer to get Android OS. Furthermore, we need a special hardware for Android TV. 
Extra Space on ROM means bigger price, and extra tax in Europe </pre>
            ⤷ Philips Projection : <span class="time">2 months ago</span>
            <pre>Casing: yes it's a cost, if you go to a restaurant and ask extra topping on your pizza you will need to pay for it. As the discount is already very high, we don't have space to add more things. We really want to get the best for you but at one point it is not feasible. 
Concerning the 800 lumens, reviews will come as soon as we ship the samples to the Press.

You say that your color ansi lumens was calculated differently than other projectors, but you still compare yours with them. So what is the truth here?

            <pre>Hello Seyedamirhosein.
I think the answer is clear: 1000 lumens on A brand is different from 1000 lumens on B brand. If you buy 2 different product advertising the same lumens, you will see a big difference of brightness. So in order for our customer to get the idea of the amount of lumens, we measured our PicoPix Max and compared with other devices. If we compare to our PicoPix Pro, its much more bright and if we compare to other devices advertising 800 lumens, we are on the same level. Cheers!</pre>

So, it is safe to say that the 600 color ANSI lumen is equal to 200 ANSI lumen ?</pre>

        <pre class="comment">Hi Philips team,

I agree with people who said that a realistic stretch goal must not be on the critical path of the main product, that is the PicoPix Max. 
Therefore a hard case for its safety could be a very cool stretch goal : high value for backers, weak impact for Philips’ production plan. 
Hey, Backers, do you vote for that ?

But Philips, don’t miss the main point : your product’s promises are  terrific, we are looking forward to having it in hands !
Best.

            <pre>Is there a repair place in Canada? Or would I have to ship to the States? Either way, shipping is expensive here. I'm excited for this projector, but not for the battery. The strict endeavours for Philips' idea for the future does not go with this short lasting battery, nor the lack of consumers ability to access and replace the battery (this is the disposable mindset). All it results in extra carbon emissions, extra plastic and extra expense. Please consider a larger cycle battery at least. TY!</pre>

Please excuse me if this has already been answered; I couldn't find it -

I understand that the device will support casting *from* android phone etc., but will it support casting *to* devices e.g. tablet or Android TV.? It could be helpful for diagnostic purposes, but also to access all the great features of the PicoPix; if the DLP engine could be simultaneously turned off to save LED life I'd be very happy indeed.!

Keep up the good work! :)</pre>

            ⤷ Philips Projection : <span class="time">2 months ago</span>
            <pre>hello David, the PicoPix Max is a receiver, not a client. So you cannot cast from the device to other device like TVs for eg. </pre>
            ⤷ David Johnston : <span class="time">2 months ago</span>
            <pre>Thanks, understood - to keep it compatible with protected content, issues would practically arise. 
For me personally, it was a hope that I could use the sound system attached to my android TV with the TV picture off, but I'm sure I'll find a solution for my needs.
Still very much looking forward to next month - it's important to know what the device won't do as much as all the great stuff it is capable of!

Thank you all for your continued efforts on this exciting new tech! This will be my first projector and I want to optimize the AV experience and setup convenience.

I have just trialled an Elephas pico projector and while the projector itself isn't up to it, it did come with a very well designed, secure and protective case. I can't believe it would be too expensive to design. Would you not consider replacing the one you show in the pictures with something like that?</pre>

1) Bluetooth 5 #1 priority for multi headphones and stereo speakers
2) 3D. Yeah it's a bit retro but even the cheapest Aliexpress projectors have it. Don't be lame! At least make sure the hardware is there!
3) Android TV would be better. Optional Firmeware update?

            <pre>Hello Brendon, we don't know if Disney or the new apps will be compatible as they are not out here. We will test in the future but they won't be pré installed. A lot of apps are country sensitive and we cannot load all of them. You will be able to load it from the store or direct apk. More over you cannot install android TV as it requires a special cpu and is like a new operating system. Like trying to install MacOs on a Pc. Cheers!</pre>
            ⤷ Brendon McCarthy : <span class="time">2 months ago</span>
            <pre>Thanks for the reply. Amazon Prime, Hulu, Disney, HBO all have current apps that could be tested before launch to confirm compatibility :) For app stores, Google Play (https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/google-play-store/) could also be tested? Or any of the more secure third-party stores like F-Droid, APKPure. RE: Android TV, the concern is if apps will be TV friendly, Android TV apps are designed for TV (e.g. https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/youtube-for-android-tv-android-tv/).</pre>

            <pre>HB, in terms of speakers, as our engine and battery are bigger, our speakers are a little bit less powerful compared to Nebula.

            <pre>Hey, thanks for these honest answers. That is what I thought and that's why I since the begining of the campaign I asked if some hardware upgrade on the speakers (to cover fan noise and deliver a proper all-in-one experience) would be possible. Any update on that part? Thanks</pre>
            ⤷ Philips Projection : <span class="time">2 months ago</span>
            <pre>Hello HB, the fan noise is totally covered by the speakers. Even if we have smaller speakers than some of our competitors, they sound great. No we have no space to implement bigger speakers. </pre>
            ⤷ H B : <span class="time">2 months ago</span>
            <pre>I hope it is covered haha, but I meant at lower volume because sometimes you dont want to push volume at max level. I tried the 5w speaker on the Capsule I and it was pretty much trash, that's why I'm concerned about those 2 x 4w tiny speakers (the Capsule 2 8w speaker is actually good (deep and loud)).</pre>
            ⤷ Philips Projection : <span class="time">2 months ago</span>
            <pre>HB, it's just a question of space. Bigger speaker, bigger power, need bigger space. Adding the same speakers used on the Nebula would increase the size of our projector by at least 4cm high... </pre>
            ⤷ H B : <span class="time">2 months ago</span>
            <pre>Maybe something not as big, but like a middle ground, is there a big difference in terms of space for 5 or 6 watts speakers that would contribute to offer a better experience?</pre>

I believe that your technology can give us a better image that feels brighter but I would like to know the exact ANSI lumen number for the projector. Everyone will of course take consideration of the "extra bits" that makes it feel more vivid. It is very risky that you keep advertising it as 800 "nonstandard" lumens.</pre>

            <pre>Xiaolan, Thank you for your answer. The 800 Lumens has been calculated by our engineers and also compared to many brands selling their device at 800 Lumens. We also compared some other brand advertising 1000 but our projector had the same brightness. </pre>

There has been already a lot of talk about how you can power and charge your PicoPix Max with a 45W power bank - which is a great feature!

Question I have in mind is that have you tested out any specific (name&amp;brand) 45 W power bank(s) that can power and (underlining) CHARGE PicoPix Max? And you must know that there are loads of different kind of power banks to choose from that CLAIM to have 45 W charging...which might not be true at all.</pre>

I know there has been discussion about battery mode using 600 lumens rather than 800 for better battery life. Is it possible to make an option for changing the amount of lumens used in the settings, so if we want to have more light, even with greater battery drain, we can make that decision?</pre>

            class="comment">Just what HB said. You say that ANSI Lumens and ANSI Color lumens are not same. Still you compare Nebula Capsule II 200 ANSI Lumens to Pico Pix Max 800 ANSI Color Lumens directly. How much more bright is Philips PicoPix Max really? What’s difference of ANSI Lumens and yours ANSI Color Lumens? Yes it’s fullhd but we are not talking of resolution, we are talking about brightness and using different measurements that we don’t fully understand.</pre>

            ⤷ Philips Projection : <span class="time">2 months ago</span>
            <pre>Mika, 
Even without comparing us to this competitor, we can already tell you that we are more bright because they use an old TI DMD which is only 120 ANSI, enhanced to 200 and only 720p. More Over, we just tested the Nebula Capsule 2 now in front of our PicoPix Max: 1: the throw ratio is higher on Capsule, meaning their image is far smaller than our with the same wall distance. In terms or brightness, this has nothing to do, closed to 4 times higher</pre>

If only sales tax, that's ok, but if I have to pay for customs also that means I'll pay about %60 more. It's weird but projectors are "luxury" items in Turkey so they charge double rate ( %20x2 ) for customs..</pre>

            <pre>Hello There, if you read the entire conversation from the beginning, this topic has been approached several times. We concluded that Android OS is the best solution. It is not a question of money but a question of usability. Also, Android TV requires Netflix full integration which they are not able to support if you don't sell less the 500,000 units of 1 device (PicoPix Max). Also, it requires a special platform, meaning we would need to totally change the PCBA. Thanks and have a great day!</pre>

Or at least provide a better hard-shell shock proof case instead of a soft neoprene case that offers no protection?

Thanks for all the replies so far.
I have another query on the durability of the PicoPix Max. As this is advertised as a portable projector that we can bring anywhere we want, does this device have any shockproof rating? As we will be bringing it around in our luggage/bagpack/etc. there are bound to be some vigorous movements involved. Especially in check-in luggages where the airport staffs tend to chuck them around roughly.</pre>

            <pre>Unfortunately, the rule that ANSI Lumens are a universal measurement of brightness for projectors is simply not the case. ANSI Lumens refers to the measurement of determining the brightness of white pixels and was adapted for lamp based projectors. Current projector technology like LED projectors with RGB-B have better color saturation and appear brighter than lamp based projectors. </pre>
            ⤷ Philips Projection : <span class="time">2 months ago</span>
            <pre>With the evolution of both the content that we watch and the projectors themselves, standard ANSI Lumens are now obsolete. We are using the term Color Lumens which better describes how bright the image will actually look. Essentially, Color Lumens = Lumens + Vivid Color + Fine Tuned Picture Settings.

Thanks for your ideas! There is already a bag inside the box in fact. Using the box itself it not something we are willing to do because we cannot use plastic or metal. If we use only carton, that won't be a lasting solution. We will launch some accessories just after the campaign! have a great day</pre>
            ⤷ patrizio ceresa : <span class="time">2 months ago</span>
            <pre>Yes, i know, but i was thinking something like Nintendo labo, cardboard can be Fun and usefull even if it not lasting forever, i love Travel for more than one day and carry the power adapter an hdmi cable and tripode in the same box could be lovely, a well thinked box is better than a empty box that go rigth to the trash. Except for that i love the way You are entroducing this Project </pre>

            <pre>Hello Patrizio, yes it's true but at Philips, we prefer to provide long lasting solution. Don't worry the bag inside the box will help you to carry all the accessories!</pre>

Looking forward to this, looks amazing. I hope the battery bypass is going in, it'd be great to be able to keep using this even when the battery has issues. One question: on Facebook you commented that the throw ratio is 1.2 and 144" would be needed to get a 120" projection, while here I always read about 126". Could you clarify so that I can start preparing the room :)?

Concerning the stretch goal, it's a good idea but this project is not only about money. Stretch goal has been defined to say: 50K to make 1 product with A-B specs in Z timeline. Making an extra Goal for C-D specs will increase a lot the timeline and we wouldn't be able to keep the schedule. As we say in French: " The most beautiful woman/man can only give what she/he has".

Similarly, when the level is displayed as “0 %” and the device switches off automatically, then the battery is NOT really completely empty either, otherwise it would be dead.</pre>

Can you explain if the number of perks is unlimited? why does the number always increase again when it is closer to 20s? I've been seeing this for few days now.

Second question: is it possible to add a battery control mode to the projector, for example a mode that will only charge the battery up to 80%, this will increase the lifetime of the battery for users who plan to keep the projector connected to a power source most of the time at their homes.

Thanks :)</pre>

Keeping the battery always charged at 100% level decreases its life, so I'm asking if it is possible to add a "battery care mode" to charge only untill 80% not 100%

My question is, you say it's "Apple Ready". Have there been any new developments since your previous models? As far as I'm reading, Apple users were having a few issues with the older PicoPix products.</pre>

            <pre>Hello Rhonda!
1: the USB-C port is fully compatible with Macbook Pro, MacBook Air and iOS devices. It will be detected like a second screen by your MacOS devices. USB-C is like HDMI 
2: Airplay works for screen mirroring, we even tested it with iOS 13.
Thanks!</pre>

            class="comment">@Aurora Friday- Almost ALL manufacturers use third party components. For example power supply, capacitors, bluetooth/wifi/dac chips. It SHOULDN'T come as a surprise that 'what's under the hood' isn't Philips proprietary components. That would mean that Philips would need factories for all of those components too! TV panels are the same deal: Philips, Sharp, Samsung, Sony, LG, Panasonic, Loewe, Hisense...arguably what's inside these TVs comes from the same supplier.</pre>

Let em laugh - they have no clue. Let us have a look at the competitors:
the xgimi z6 has no battery and is not as bright
the xgimi CC has a battery, only 720p and is not as bright
the xiaomi miija full hd projector has no battery and only chinese app-store
the quimi q8 is brighter, but more expensive, has a battery but is not smart
the quimi q38 is worse in all terms
Anker nebula capsule and Mars are worse in all terms

First of all, thank you for your donation, but we prefer to refund it as it's not in our company policy.
Second, we respect your comment that there are others "China Projector that has same features", but, on our side, our R&amp;D team has tested many and we never found ANY products that equal the quality of a Philips product.
But if you have found any, I highly suggest you to cancel your order with us ! Just tell us how you want to proceed.

Having made a survey over 1000 customers, we found out that 16Gb was enough. 1: the cost of the memory is quite expensive 2: In Europe, there is a law about the personal copy Vs Storage: the more you have storage, the highest is the fee. Our Customers didn't want to pay extra especially that we have a microSD card able to reach 512Gb and can integrate with Android as a core storage. Cheers!</pre>

This looks like a great product - I have been using the PicoPix 4935 for the past 2 years, One of my main issues I have had is with the small amount of internal RAM, which sometimes causes apps to hang and become unresponsive. 

Please can you confirm how much RAM the PicoPix Max has? I have read 16gb RAM but want to confirm this isn’t the internal storage memory? 

Also, does this use mini HDMI or full size HDMI? 

Thanks</pre>

        <pre class="comment">Hey guys,

Great work on seeing the BT5 implementation and the battery bypass! Really great features! I assume you'll keep everyone updated (with example) on the BT latency? A projector without synced audio is a bad product I'm sure you'll agree! 

I do feel a slight sting reading 600 lumens on battery. Perhaps don't market it as 800 lumens portable, it gives the wrong idea.. or add the details about it in the description.

Still, great work and keep it up!</pre>
        <div class="replies">

            <pre>Hello Geoffrey
Yes we will keep everyone updated about all the new features. We are still working on it.
For the 800 Lumens, we are always talking about "up to". The 800 are obtained with the power adapter plugged in! cheers!</pre>
            ⤷ Geoffrey : <span class="time">2 months ago</span>
            <pre>No worries, that's why I'm always skeptical of anything "up to" ;)
One more question then, just for fun. The 800 Lumens, is it also achieved when using a powerbank? I guess it'd need to supply the 45 watts perhaps?</pre>

            <pre>Here is a comparison of Bluetooth codec latencies for flagship android phones: https://www.soundguys.com/android-bluetooth-latency-22732/

The best you can get is apparently still over 200ms without aptx low latency which is simply not acceptable for video content. I can understand that it is not possible to include an aptx low latency chip at this price point but please take it into consideration.</pre>

            <pre>Dear Karl, we understand your concern. However, a projector is not a mobile phone and less likely to be targeted by malware. The number of application per projector is likely to be around 10 where smartphones can count around 150. Our users won't pay with it nor check their email directly within the projector. That's said, the PicoPix Max is already very secured ad we will do some patches but not every months. Have a great day!</pre>
            ⤷ Karl : <span class="time">2 months ago</span>
            <pre>This projector might not be a mobile phone but a mobile device which will be exposed to many hostile environments. Just like fridges (usually you dont check mail and pay with this one either) and other IOT things that gets hacked and for instance, becoming a member of a criminal botnet due to low security standards. It doesn't really matter if your device is secure right now, since that could change tomorrow. I hope you take your responsibility and focus on keeping your customers secure.</pre>

Is it possible to flip the projector display 180 degrees. For example, if mounting on a ceiling using a compatible tripod connector mount the projector would be upside down as the tripod connector is at the bottom of the unit, so the display would be upside down.

2. Is there any loss in quality when you put the projector closer to the wall? Maybe making it into a smaller screen? Any downsides?
3. You are talking about 800 ANSI color lumens. Is this the same lumens as many review/webshops websites state about their projectors when a projector for example has 200 lumens, so this one has 600 more? Or is it a different type?</pre>

How do I know when the right measurement for the 120" is set? Lets say Im outside and aim the projector at a wall. Is there any indication I should stop backing up or moving forward because I found the right spot for the 120"?</pre>

Unfortunately not! the autofocus will help you to always be focused but 120" is already really big. 3meters from the wall is easy to measure :-)</pre>

Yes it will be possible thanks to the digital zoom and won't cause any loss. The 4 point correction will still be usable after you have customized the digital zoom. However, we suggest to always place the projector in the best condition for the best viewing experience. Cheers!</pre>

            <pre>Hello Jens, it's compatible HDR10. Concerning the nits, we need to check with our engineers and let you know later. Jens, I just want to remind that is is a portable device that has already a lot of features that a home projector would do. We don't want to compete here with our Screeneo Collection which is more oriented to cinema addict. Thanks for all your suggestions!</pre>

            <pre>Dont you think that most ppl will use it as a mobile home projector, like for the bedroom, kids room etc? Think only a few are going to use it outdoors, therefore nothing wrong with some home-projector-requirements/wishes.</pre>

There is nothing inherently wrong with partnerships in tech, they happen all the time (as well as white labelling) and I’m sure this will be a great projector but would be good to know if this is a 100% ground-up product from Philips Projection or for use of a better way of putting it, a variant version of a JmGO/other also in-development product.</pre>

            <pre>How would I do what you said? Apple TV only has one HDMI out port. So how do I connect a sonos beam to it via optical when the Apple TV is connected to the PICOPIX already? Preferably I’d like very few or no wires across the room and the projector would be 10-12 feet back from the beam. Do I need to get some kind of splitters to get a HDMI out to turn into a HDMI and Optical out? Then wire up 10 feet across the room with the optical out to plug sound into the sonos beam from the Apple TV? </pre>

            ⤷ Tony Petrilli : <span class="time">2 months ago</span>
            <pre>The reason for asking about the chipset is due to what has happened on another IGG campaign for the PIQO Projector where the campaigner claimed specific capabilities and specific components. 

Only for early backers to receive it, disassemble the device, and discover that  both the capabilities and components were far less than claimed.</pre>

            <pre>Getting chipset info for your projector would go a long way to ensuring that backers are getting what is claimed.

            class="comment">Hello Philips, thank you very much for your answer "20% of charge capacity lost after 300-500 cycles". With the assumption that we will be watching a movie a day (as you are stating in the INGG page so the LED will last for 40 years), we can calculate that the battery will be dead in roughly 7 to 8 years. This won't be a concern if the power outlet can bypass the battery, it will make the battery last longer and keep the devise working when the battery ends. Please make it happen! Many thx.</pre>

2. can you extended the battery life via connecting a battery bank ?
3. does it project 4K resolution ?
4. does it project well and clear in a bright room with a white background ?

Thank you for your feedback.</pre>

1: yes for, it works on battery and/or when plugged in
2: yes, the powerbank will charge the battery 
3: no, it project Full HD 1080p, but accepts 4K input
4: The Philips PicoPix Max is made for use both indoor and outdoor. For the best results, a dimmed space is best. However, it’s bright enough that it will work well even in lit indoor spaces without direct light on the projection surface. For the most optimal use it is recommended you use PicoPix Max in an area with dim to low</pre>

This projector is perfect for my tiny apartment in Tokyo. It won't be in portable transit all the time. I need to vouch for having a product that can be portable but when plugged in to a power outlet - that becomes the main source of power to run the thing. Just my old laptop. Its battery is useless but once plugged in, it can still do the job!</pre>

            <pre>Tomislav, just to be clear:
1: the PicoPix Max runs on Battery
2: When the battery is empty, you can plug the projector to charge the battery and also use the projector at the same time
3: When the battery is fully charged, we need to check with our R&amp;D if the adapter is still charging it or bypassing it
Hope this is clear :-) </pre>

the Samsung TV (Remote) f.e. can definitely control the FireTV using HDMI-CEC protocol :-) Using it all the time when I visit my father in law!

Another Idea: The current FireTV Remote has Volume Rockers and an Power Off/On Button to pair with other Devices via Infrared. You Just need to make sure that your Philips specific Infrared Codes are known by the FireTV Operation System (A lot Philips TVs are already supported) ;-)</pre>

            ⤷ Jens : <span class="time">2 months ago</span>
            <pre>And is there no way to include a higher native contrast? Bit afraid that the picture might be looking washed out at only 600:1. Even Anker's pico-beamers got at least 1000:1. 1500:1 would of course be even better.</pre>
            ⤷ Philips Projection : <span class="time">2 months ago</span>
            <pre>Jens, Anker Capsule is 400:1 for eg. We cannot higher the native contrast because this is linked to the Texas Instrument DMD. Please keep also in mind that this is a portable device.

            <pre>Being able to use Google Assistant to initiate videos with voice is a MAJOR feature. I have the Nebula Capsule II, and this can be achieved through the Assistant-enabled remote, or through a phone, since it has Google Cast. 

Considering Philips has been around much longer and probably has deeper resources, I'd be very surprised to hear that Google wouldn't support this device, especially given that Anker was able to get certification.</pre>

            <pre>Also —&nbsp; I've had very poor results with streaming video over Airplay and Miracast. It requires quite a snappy WiFi network, and given the portable element here, it's very hard to have that guaranteed. Google Cast would make this a go for me — the rest of the features are excellent, very much including horizontal keystone.

Thanks for sharing the weight. I had searched with cmd+f, but it's listed within an image.</pre>

            <pre>Last question, regarding Lumen count —&nbsp;Nebula Capsule lists 200 ANSI lumens. I saw a prior response that didn't really address the commenter's question about brightness. Can you provide a comparison of the brightness of this device against other products on the market? Capsule 2 would be great, since it feels like a direct competitor.</pre>
            ⤷ Philips Projection : <span class="time">2 months ago</span>
            <pre>Hello Michael, yes we have the Capsule 2 here and we will compare is soon. our PicoPix Max cannot directly compete because its resolution is Full HD but the Capsule 2 is only HD. More Over, their Netflix version only project in 480p. Have a great day!</pre>
            ⤷ michaelketigian : <span class="time">2 months ago</span>
            <pre>Yes I know it's 720 vs 1080, but that shouldn't affect brightness... they claim 200 ANSI. I'd be surprised if this is 4x brighter, but would love to see a photo comparison. 

Also, can't overstate the importance of Google Cast support, or a similar kind of Assistant integration. It makes the UX soooo much better than dealing with directional pad text input ?‍♂️

Yeah 480p Netflix is lame. I'm open to an improved setup, and have voiced my requirements to upgrade! ?</pre>
            ⤷ Philips Projection : <span class="time">2 months ago</span>
            <pre>Hello Michael, thanks for your input, the DMD and Light engine as nothing to do with them so we cannot really compare. For the assistant, you need to have Android TV to get the Google assistant and we didn't decided to go that way because the PicoPix Max is a portable device. We are discussing with another brand doing those kind of assistant but it's too early to talk about it :-) Hope you gonna like our Max!</pre>

            class="comment">Can you please clarify the Lumens?
ANSI Color Lumens doesn't exist. It exist ANSI lumens and Color Light Output. The CLO method is similar to ANSI, but instead of using a 100% white test pattern, one uses red, green and blue test patterns instead. Separate meter readings are taken for red, green, and blue, then added together. It means that if 800 is the sum it's something between 250 to 300 ANSI Lumens. I thought Philips was an honest company.</pre>

            ⤷ Philips Projection : <span class="time">2 months ago</span>
            <pre>Dear Lorenzo, thanks for your question. We understand your concern. Unfortunately, the rule that ANSI Lumens are a universal measurement of brightness for projectors is simply not the case. ANSI Lumens refers to the measurement of determining the brightness of white pixels and was adapted for lamp based projectors. Current projector technology like LED projectors with RGB-B have better color saturation and appear brighter than lamp based projectors. </pre>
            ⤷ Philips Projection : <span class="time">2 months ago</span>
            <pre>With the evolution of both the content that we watch and the projectors themselves, standard ANSI Lumens are now obsolete. The reality is that is you take 2 projectors from 2 different brands with the same advertised ANSI lumens, you will see a very big difference. We are using the term Color Lumens which better describes how bright the image will actually look. Essentially, Color Lumens = Lumens + Vivid Color + Fine Tuned Picture Settings.
</pre>
            ⤷ Lorenzo Monachini : <span class="time">2 months ago</span>
            <pre>You explained what is Color Lumens, but I can't understand what is ANSI Color Lumens. ANSI is a thing and Color Lumens seems to be very different. I'm agree that nowaday with Led projector ANSI is not accurate, but it is a standard measurement, here you're inventing something else so you can't write ANSI if it doesn't respect the ANSI measurement. </pre>

        <pre class="comment">Hi, since my previous questions are not  answered, I will rephrase and repost:
1. Regarding VAT, I assume you are gonna declare the price of product as the full price (899 EUR excludes VAT) instead of the discount price to the customs, right? This matters because how much VAT I need to pay depends on how much you declare.
2. Nena's question (2 levels below me) is also my doubt. Please answer it.</pre>

        <pre class="comment">Hi team, since many answers are avoided, let me ask again :
1- do you agree to refund if your forwarder wants to charge more than VAT, as it happens when they need to handle taxes ?
2- Which refresh rates are being natively displayed (50Hz, 60Hz, 23.976Hz, 24Hz, 25Hz)?
3- VAT only applies to purchased items. We are contributing money towards the completion of your project and you provide us samples in return.
Why should we pay VAT ?

            <pre>Bonjour Nicolas!
As a backer, you are contributing towards a project. This project is to be the very first to buy a product at very aggressive conditions. We asked several time our legal team and their answer is quite clear: each backer will receive a product against his contribution to the project. So in fact, according to local laws in US and Europe, you are indirectly buying a product, and therefore, you have to pay the VAT. </pre>

Also, in my country, when we buy something online, we are eligible BY LAW to consumer warranties, which do not exist when contributing to indiegogo's projects.</pre>

As per crowdfunding definition, we are not purchasing items, we are contributing money towards the completion of a project and the owner of that project graciously decides to provide us samples in return.
Technically, this is not a sale and that is why crowdfunding is such a dangerous business for backers.
In such scenario, do VAT apply?, it has not been a sale of a product.</pre>

Another shipping question for you. I am in Canada, so I am assuming that you will be shipping to Canada from the United States. If this is the case, then Duty may be involved along with any potential taxes. 

Can you confirm that you would be shipping to me from the U.S. and if I will likely have to face duty charges?</pre>

FedEx is ever so slightly better, but also quite high. So please, if this is the case,  use the US Post.</pre>

            <pre>Thanks.

            ⤷ Philips Projection : <span class="time">2 months ago</span>
            <pre>Cronan, if you have an Apple TV, you can connect it via HDMI to the PicoPix Max, and wire the optical out of your Apple TV to Sonos. Then within the Apple TV interface, you can forward the sound to optical out. Wish you a nice day</pre>

            <pre>Been reading up on this as sounds complicated. So read on another forum that I should be able to do it. As have a sonos beam paired with to play1’s. So when I said Airplay I should have said Airplay 2.  I think I should be able to just hook up my Apple TV version 3 to this projector and select the above sonos setup as my audio and Airplay 2 the sound to my beam which in turn makes the surround sound work.

I’ve been reading about different way around this and they all seem pretty expensive.

You can connect your Switch to the USB-C video port on our PicoPix Max, but you will need to connect your switch to a power adapter otherwise your console won't be able to screen mirror anything. </pre>
            ⤷ Philips Projection : <span class="time">2 months ago</span>
            <pre>You will need the cradle in any case because USB-C is not a video standard, it is a connection standard. The Switch outputs video as DisplayPort over the USB-C connection. The dock then converts the DisplayPort video into HDMI video. That video then leaves the dock and goes into your TV via the HDMI output connection. Better use the HDMI on your cradle</pre>

I just had one last question: Any idea how much the "premium digital zoom" can shrink the image size by? For example, if it was a 120" image could it be shrunk down to a 60" image?
Ps I think mini toslink/3.5mm is clever idea (like airport express/macbook) and another 'backer' mentioned HDMI ARC. One of these would be handy for future-proofing or dealing with potential sync/audio latency issues.

            <pre>Thanks so much for the quick reply. Your graphics say that this will work with airplay, (which is how I would prefer to connect to the Apple TV). When you give an update I’m interested in hearing more about how this works- as as I’m not aware of any other android devices which can do that?</pre>
            ⤷ Philips Projection : <span class="time">2 months ago</span>
            <pre>Hello Theo! You are welcome.
Your iOS devices, MacOS devices can simply use the Airplay system to throw image and videos directly to our projector (Screen Mirroring). But you cannot connect your Apple TV to our PicoPix Max via Airplay because they are both receivers. Better to connect it via HDMI! Have a great day</pre>

There are no portable power banks with that much power output. I've got a quite expensive one from Anker (20,000 mAh) and it has 15 W output.

This is a portable device, so you have to try to find some middle-ground. You can't make a do-everything gadget. Size and battery life are KEY factors for a portable device.

"Concerning the sound, we are working on it" meaning you might consider an upgrade on the speakers?

            <pre>Hello HB, Very good sound means space. The speaker room (the box where is the speaker) is as much important as the speaker used, as well as the tuning made for them. in the case of the Capsule, they used a very big space for the speakers, but they sacrifice the brightness, battery and resolution. For sure we need to get the best sound as possible, but we cannot increase the size of our product, nor decrease other specifications. We are looking at a solutions for speakers and BT5.</pre>

Again, what people also like with the Capsule is that they dont need to buy/bring an external bluetooth speaker. It is a portable/travel projector so it has to be versatile.

Plenty of more powerfull, cheaper (and little bigger) projectors are already on the market if you mostly want to leave it at home and pair it with speakers.</pre>

            <pre>Hello, thanks for the fast reply. So please consider that shipping directly from china to mainland europe makes shipping incredibly expensive. Therefore it would be appreciated if there was a way to have it send from an european warehouse. For you as an internationale company this shouldnt be a problem, should it?!?

Concerning the sound, is there a way for 5.1 somehow? </pre>

            <pre>Hello Jens, the shipping is offered but you will still need to pay for the VAT anyhow. Concerning the sound, this is a portable projector and following our survey based on 1000 people, around 78% of them preferred to concentrate on other great features.</pre>

            class="comment">Hi, just wondering if 2x 4w speakers would not be too weak for a travel projector.

        <div class="replies">
            ⤷ Philips Projection : <span class="time">2 months ago</span>
            <pre>Hello HB.
IN order to maximise the size of the product, we need to keep the speakers as small as possible but the power delivered is enough. For example the bluetooth speaker JBL Clip 3 is only 1x3watts and made for outdoor!</pre>
            ⤷ H B : <span class="time">2 months ago</span>
            <pre>Yes but the capsule I has a 5w speaker and it is actually really weak. The Capsule II I own has 8w and it's much better (deep and loud). I don't want to feel a sound downgrade switching to the PP Max and that is probably the only thing Capsule II has over the PP Max (and Android TV OS maybe).</pre>
            ⤷ Philips Projection : <span class="time">2 months ago</span>
            <pre>Hi HB, the Capsule 2 is only HD 720P, our PicoPix Max is Full HD 1080p, this is one of the biggest difference on the capsule, there are many other features that are no in the Capsule and I can detail them if you want to. You wont regret moving to the PicoPix Max!</pre>
            ⤷ H B : <span class="time">2 months ago</span>
            <pre>Yes thats why i said your speakers and maybe the OS are the only downsides in comparaison with the Capsule 2. The Capsule 2 has an 8w speaker with a very good sound and Im not sure 2x 4w can match that. It would be too bad to have a better picture but a worst sound than your only direct competitor. 

Android TV OS is very good too. </pre>
            ⤷ Philips Projection : <span class="time">2 months ago</span>
            <pre>hello HB, it really depends on the consumer target, a lot of our consumers prefer to get Android OS rather than Android TV. You can get Android TV quiet easily but you wont be able to get Neftlix on Android TV because they require very big volume on the same device (around 500K unit per year). That's why we chose Android OS for the moment. Concerning the sound, we are working on it :-)</pre>
            ⤷ H B : <span class="time">2 months ago</span>
            <pre>I am sure you’ll make a great software and sell 500K/year with good speakers ;)
“Concerning the sound, we are working on it” meaning you might consider an upgrade on the speakers?

Speakers are important, as I said an all in one solution require good speakers. Also, will you be able to use it only as an external bluetooth speaker without projection? The Capsule II can do that too and it is quite usefull.

The Philips PicoPix Max is made for use both indoor and outdoor. For the best results, a dimmed space is best. However, it’s bright enough that it will work well even in lit indoor spaces without direct light on the projection surface. For the most optimal use it is recommended you use PicoPix Max in an area with dim to low ambient lighting.</pre>

            <pre>Hello Ticanaus.
Our engineers have found that the term ANSI Lumens can vary from manufacturer to manufacturer, as the term generally refers to outdated technology and has yet to be updated to describe the performance of a projector when rendering full color imagery. We are using the term Color Lumens as defined by our engineers to measure the real number of lumens based on the color/brightness/gamma adjustment settings we have defined in our lab. Essentially, Color Lumens = Lumens + Vivid Color </pre>

1. You won't pay VAT for the product even if you ship within Europe. Backers should be responsible for the additional VAT themselves, am I right?
2. If it is not related to VAT, why there is a price difference? I paid 419 euros instead of 399 euros.
3. Would you declare the full product price or the discounted price to the customs? If full price, it means I need to pay 50% EXTRA as VAT. Declaring as GIFT won't help in Sweden.</pre>

            <pre>It seems you did not fully understand me. First of all, I am in Sweden, the VAT rate is 25%. However, how much I need to pay additionally depends on how much you declare the price to the customs. If you declare the full price, then I need to pay 25% percent of the full price as VAT; which is 50% of the current price as VAT. That would be totally out of rational price range. So pls let me know how you are gonna declare the price when shipping.</pre>

            <pre>Dear Fabien, the source (your BD Player or gaming console) will do the decoding and if you want to play the image over the PicoPix Max and forward the 5.1 sound to your AV receiver, it will be possible to do it via optical out for eg. If your movie is played from the internet or your USB stick/MicroSD, VLC or Kodi will do the decoding. You won't be able to send the signal from the projector to an AV receiver because our device is not dedicated for home cinema like but portable and standalone.</pre>

How long is the power cable you have for the projector? Can you include a longer cable (5+ meter) so we can power the device without it being next to the socket.

Can you make an app so we could control the projector on an android phone?

            <pre>Hello, 
We use a standard one same as for your camera. Our R&amp;D team is still maximising the power input, should be around 45w but we are still fine tuning it.
The cable will be between 1 and 1.2 m long.
Concerning the APP, we will start to develop it in a second stage, we are now concentrating on the projector itself and the AirMote control.
Yes we have an Eco mode! This is not a lamp but a LED :-)</pre>

An example would be when these are manufactured in China, you pay tax on the cost of the item, not the cost once you resell it.

As this item is not yet available on the retail market, this further qualifies as a preproduction sample.

There is no benefit to charging us taxes when you are already making a profit</pre>

The Xgimi Z6 is not a smart projector and doesn't embed a battery. This is not a portable projector. More over, Philips is dedicated to image perfection since decades and we work with internal and external image professional to fine tune the colors to perfection. Don't forget that you will also get a 24 months Worldwide warranty and a call center to help you in case you need it.</pre>

            <pre>My 3 cousin is interested in buying the projector. Only the question which projector will perform better in terms of quality, colours and which will be more clear. I saw the Xgimi projector video on YouTube and found it very satisfying.  So your reply will help my cousin to decide which one to go for. If your projector is going to perform better than the Xgimi in terms of colour and clear quality they will pledge for your projector.
I am already convinced with your product.</pre>

            <pre>Dear Marcos

Our engineers have found that the term ANSI Lumens can vary from manufacturer to manufacturer. We are using the term Color Lumens as defined by our engineers to measure the real number of lumens based on the color/brightness/gamma adjustment settings we have defined in our lab. Essentially, Color Lumens = Lumens + More Vivid Color + Fine Tuned Picture Settings.

            <pre>Hello Marcos, unfortunately you are right and wrong. Yes, there's a way to calculate it, a supposed "standard", but unfortunately, the whole industry leaders are using different kind of measurements. Several journalists already pointed out this issue. On our side, we believe that our measure is the closest from the reality. Sorry if this is not the answer you were expecting, but this is the reality.</pre>

        <pre class="comment">Bonjour,

Lisant les commentaires à propos de la TVA, si j’ai bien compris il y aura des frais supplémentaires par rapport au prix annoncé (cela aurait pu être mis plus en avant car ce n’est mentionné nulle part) pouvez vous me dire à combien exactement elle s’élève et comment devra t elle réglée ?

        <pre class="comment">I was reading the comments about VAT. When buying a product shipped from EU to EU , VAT is included in the price. So no extra taxes has to be applied. - Please clarify this. 
If the projector is shipped from outside EU (which doesn’t make sense if you have a distribution center here), then I’m not interested in paying 23% extra + admin and handling fees.

2- Are you offering free shipping as the perk says, or are you just passing this bill to us at the delivery?</pre>
        <div class="replies">
            ⤷ Philips Projection : <span class="time">2 months ago</span>
            <pre>Dear Maria,
The price we are proposing does not include VAT for many legal reasons. All offers on Indiegogo do the same for those reasons.
As per the shipping, depending on the perk, you chose, it's offered and won't be mention on the bill. We deal directly with the forwarder.
Thanks for your interest !</pre>

            <pre>I’ve backed multiple projects in Indiegogo and I’m also a superbacker in KS and never had to pay VATif shipped from EU.
I backed the single perk (419€) - Could you tell me where this perk ships from, please? 
Just to clarify:
1- when you say it won’t be mentioned on the bill, do you mean it’s marked as a gift/reward?
2- dealing directly with the forwarded means we asume shipping cost? 

The previous answers are vague and didn’t clarify my concerns.

Thanks again

            ⤷ Nena : <span class="time">2 months ago</span>

Thanks, </pre>
            ⤷ Nena : <span class="time">2 months ago</span>
            <pre>Hi Philips, 
Yes, marked as gift/ reward instead of a purchase, as it’s what we are actually doing.  
I own a Xgimi CC Aurora with all the features in this projector (but 300 ANSI Lumens). So if my final price is gonna increase a lot more due to the extra expenses mentioned above, it won’t worth it to me. 

Also, could you tell me if my reward is gonna be shipped from Europe, please? 
Them I can make up my mind. 

Thanks doe your time</pre>
            ⤷ Philips Projection : <span class="time">2 months ago</span>
            <pre>Hey Maria, 
Be careful, the Aurora is HD 720p but our device is Full HD 1080p.
Also our PicoPix Max is much smaller, get a trackpad on the top, has USB-C for direct video on Apple, Android and Windows, got 4 corner corrections...</pre>
            ⤷ Nena : <span class="time">2 months ago</span>
            <pre>Thank you. Aurora has corners correction too. So will you ship from Europe? Willing to keep my pledge as you stated above in another comment that the parcel will be marked as gift. Thank you for that :)</pre>

            class="comment">I am excited to see in person how this performs. I have also contributed to another Pico projector on Indiegogo and plan a head-to-head competition.

The #1 weakness that jumped out at me was the internal storage. With the prices of various storage options on the market at cheap prices, 128GB should be the BARE minimum, but since this is video 256GB minimum with a 512GB option would make much more sense. I mean I have a S10+ phone with 1TB internal storage (yes retail $ is high).</pre>

But we did wanted to address the 10% left, this is why we added a MicroSD solution (and of course USB).

            <pre>I believe that in the 90% that responded to lead you to a 16GB solution, probably 75% of those respondents don't understand storage needs for video, prices, etc. What is the max capacity of the SD Card slot, for if it's 512Gb or higher than that would alleviate most storage issues. But honestly in this day and age I feel that a 16GB internal memory solution is a cost cutting measure that can be measured probably in a few dollars. I personally like ability for high end internal storage.</pre>

As you know Philips is not an homogene company. It is a brand that many companies like TPVision for the TVs exploits.

The Philips PicoPix cannot be found anywhere on Philip's website, or any products affiliated with Philips, so this product could very well be a scam.

Wish you guys doubled battery capacity and sold a higher resolution version for your 55% off price.
The best feature is the brightness of the projector. Everything else is pretty average.</pre>

Thanks for your email. 
Many A brand like Bose for example are using Indiegogo campaign to gather comments about their product. We are proud to partner with Indiegogo to launch this new product!
Could you point us with other product with the same spec and price?
Thanks!</pre>
            ⤷ Scott Yamamoto : <span class="time">2 months ago</span>
            <pre>I simply googled. 
The unique feature is the lamp power of 800 lumens. For a screen size of 120 inches I would expect a higher output resolution. Could you explain 4k compatible? Does that mean it just scales it down to 1080p or can the projector technically produce a higher image quality?
The 3hr. Battery life is not giving wiggle room for your product when the battery gets old. Movies can run for 3hrs. 
How far does the device have to be to produce a 120inch screen?</pre>

Everybody has a question that if this is legitimate Philips product or a Scam. The Philips customer care team don't know anything about this sale or product. Neither the picopix.com website mention has any relations with Philips official site.

            <pre>Hello Christer, 

The Philips PicoPix Max will project an image in Full HD. If you plug an external BLuray player or Apple TV 4K, the signal will be 4K and the projector will project Full HD. 
Concerning HDR, the projector will decode HDR signal and adjust all colors like a TV</pre>

            <pre>Okay, I got the 4K part. No 4K support, you downscale it. Sneaky marketing.

Will the projector display an HDR image, or "convert" HDR to SDR? Your answer was not clear to me and I don't know what you mean by "adjust all colors like a TV". Please explain wether it has HDR capabilities or not. Your marketing material clearly is making that statement, but you're not backing that up anywhere else.</pre>
